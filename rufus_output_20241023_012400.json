From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Map of Earth with country borders and big cities shown Geography (from Greek : γεωγραφία , geographia , literally \"earth description\") [ 1 ] is the study of earth and its people and one of social sciences . [ 2 ] Its features are things like continents , seas , rivers and mountains . Its inhabitants are all the people and animals that live on it. Its phenomena are the things that happen like tides , winds , and earthquakes . A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer . A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed. [ 3 ] Geography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography . Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment. The human environmental studies would include things such as the population in a country, how a country's economy is doing, and more. There is also environmental geography. Maps are a main tool of geography, so geographers spend much time making and studying them. Making maps is called cartography , and people who specialize in making maps are cartographers. Branches [ change | change source ] Physical geography [ change | change source ] See the main article: Physical geography Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an Earth science . It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of lithosphere , hydrosphere , atmosphere , pedosphere, and global flora and fauna patterns ( biosphere ). Physical geography can be divided into many broad categories, including: Biogeography Climatology & Meteorology Coastal geography Environmental management Geodesy Geomorphology Glaciology Hydrology & Hydrography Landscape ecology Oceanography Pedology Palaeogeography Quaternary science Human geography [ change | change source ] A crowd of people around a band. Human geography is the social science that covers the study of people and their communities, cultures, economies and their interaction with the environment. Geographers studying the human environment may look at: Population Countries of the world Land use Agriculture City Industry Energy Pollution History [ change | change source ] The oldest known world map dates back to ancient Babylon from the 9th century BC. [ 4 ] The best known Babylonian world map is the Imago Mundi of 600 BC. [ 5 ] Star charts (maps of the sky) are of similar age. During the Middle Ages , people in Europe made fewer maps. People in the eastern countries made more. [ 6 ] Abū Zayd al-Balkhī created the \"Balkhī school\" of mapping in Baghdad . [ 7 ] Western Europe became known as the leader of geographic thought during the European Renaissance and The Age of Exploration (1400–1600). The printing press made maps and information about the world available to everyone. This caused more interest in how the world worked. In the 1700s and 1800s scientists started to study the relationship between the environment and its people Related pages Geographer Geographical renaming Geopolitics International Geographical Union Landform Map Navigator References [ change | change source ] ↑ Harper, Douglas. \"Online Etymology Dictionary\" .

While cookies and other locally stored data technologies may not be necessary to use our sites, some features may not function properly if you disable them. You can: remove or disable specific locally stored data on your browser's settings (you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent); use a browser that can block third-party cookies; or install a plug-in to block locally stored data, if one is available. Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent tracking pixels from tracking your specific activity. A tracking pixel may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your browser-based email client, and that may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This article needs more sources for reliability . Please help improve this article by adding reliable sources .  Unsourced material may be challenged or removed. Find sources: \"GNU Free Documentation License\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) GNU Free Documentation License The GFDL logo Author Free Software Foundation Version 1.3 Published Current version : November 3, 2008 DFSG compatible Yes, with no invariant sections (see below) Free software Yes GPL compatible No Copyleft Yes GNU logo The GNU Free Documentation License ( GNU FDL or simply GFDL ) is a copyleft license for open content such as software. It was made by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU project. It was initially created for use with software documentation, but can be applied to other types of works as well, such as Wikipedia . As a copyright license, the GFDL is a type of contract between the creator of a copyrightable work (such as a book , an encyclopedia article, a painting , or a piece of music ) and anyone else who might want to use it. The GFDL is considered \"copyleft\" because the license is meant to make it easier to use and re-use the copyrighted work, not to restrict its use. If a copyrightable work is released under the GFDL, the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce, distribute, or modify the work, as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the GFDL. Among the requirements of the GFDL are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the GFDL—that is, once something is licensed as GFDL, it will always stay licensed as GFDL, and anything which uses it also is licensed as GFDL. The GFDL also says that in order to distribute or modify a work licensed with the GFDL, the re-user must give credit to any previous authors of the work, and include a list of changes they made to the work. Finally, any work licensed with the GFDL must contain, somewhere, the entire text of the license. This provision has been criticized, because it is not always easy to include an entire, long license with a copyrighted work. In a book, for example, it is easy to include one extra page with the license, but if the work is something like a song, or a photograph, it is not easy. The GFDL has other requirements that are more complicated. For example, if part of the work is labeled as an \"invariant section,\" it cannot ever be removed or changed by someone using the work (\"invariant\" means \"does not change\"). Works licensed under the GFDL may be included in with non-GFDL-licensed works only if it is clear which parts of the work are licensed as the GFDL. For example, in a book of poetry it would be easy to label some poems as licensed under the GFDL and some not licensed under it. But it would not be easy to label if part of a song was licensed as GFDL and the rest was not, so this would not be allowed. Any use of GFDL material which violates the terms of the GFDL is potentially copyright infringement . Infringement issues are managed through a community based approach with the approval and assistance of the Free Software Foundation. [ 1 ] A number of online projects use the GFDL. An online project to license its content under the GFDL is Wikipedia . [ 2 ] The GFDL has been criticized by many people who wish that it made it even easier for content to be re-used. Among the criticisms are that it is very hard to combine GFDL material with other copyleft licenses, that it is not always clear and easy to understand, and that some of its requirements, such as the \"invariant sections\", are not free at all. History [ change | change source ] The GFDL was released in draft form for feedback in September 1999. [ 3 ] After revisions, version 1.1 was issued in March 2000, version 1.2 in November 2002, and version 1.3 in November 2008. The current state of the license is version 1.3. [ 4 ] Conditions [ change | change source ] Material licensed under the current version of the license can be used for any purpose, as long as the use meets certain conditions. All previous authors of the work must be credited. All changes to the work must be logged. All derivative works must be licensed under the same license. The full text of the license, unmodified invariant sections as defined by the author if any, and any other added warranty disclaimers (such as a general disclaimer alerting readers that the document may not be accurate for example) and copyright notices from previous versions must be maintained. Technical measures such as DRM may not be used to control or obstruct distribution or editing of the document.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For statistics about Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Statistics . The normal distribution in Statistics Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing, reading and presenting data. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Descriptive statistics make summaries of data. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Inferential statistics makes predictions. [ 6 ] Statistics helps in the study of many other fields, such as science , medicine , [ 7 ] economics , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] psychology , [ 10 ] politics [ 11 ] and marketing . [ 12 ] Someone who works in statistics is called a statistician . In addition to being the name of a field of study, the word \"statistics\"  can also mean numbers that are used to describe data or relationships. History [ change | change source ] The first known statistics are census data. The Babylonians did a census around 3500 BC , the Egyptians around 2500 BC, and the Ancient Chinese around 1000 BC. Several mathematicians during the Islamic Golden Age studied statistical inference , mainly for use in cryptanalysis . Starting in the 16th century, mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano developed the probability theory ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] this led statistics closer to being a science. Since then, people have collected and studied statistics on many things. Trees , starfish , stars , rocks , words , almost anything that can be counted has been a subject of statistics. Collecting data [ change | change source ] Before we can describe the world with statistics, we must collect data . The data that we collect in statistics are called measurements . After we collect data, we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement. For example, suppose that we want to find out how popular a certain TV show is. We can pick a group of people (called a sample ) out of the total population of viewers. Then we ask each viewer in the sample how often they watch the show. The sample is data that one can see, and the population is data that one cannot see (assuming that not every viewer in the population are asked). For another example, if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure , we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after. Descriptive and inferential statistics [ change | change source ] Numbers that describe the data one can see are called descriptive statistics. Numbers that make predictions about the data one cannot see are called inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves using numbers to describe features of data. For example, the average height of women in the United States is a descriptive statistic: it describes a feature (average height) of a population (women in the United States). Once the results have been summarized and described, they can be used for prediction. This is called inferential statistics . As an example, the size of an animal is dependent on many factors. Some of these factors are controlled by the environment, but others are by inheritance. A biologist might therefore make a model that says that there is a high probability that the offspring will be small in size—if the parents were small in size. This model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random. Testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those who are given a placebo. Methods [ change | change source ] Most often, we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments . For example, an opinion poll is one kind of survey. We pick a small number of people and we choose questions to ask them. Then, we use their answers as the data. This process of choosing which data to collect is called choosing a measurement; and the process of collecting data (in this case, who to ask) is called sampling . Samples [ change | change source ] The choice of how to collect data is important; that choice can change the values that are seen. Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake. If we take samples next to the waste drain, we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far-away and hard-to-reach spot of the lake. There are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples: If there are many samples, the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real population . If there are very few samples, however, they might be very different from what they are in the real population.  This error is called sampling error (see also Errors and residuals in statistics ). If chosen samples only account for one part of the population (like samples near the drain the beginning of the section), the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population. This is true even if a great number of samples is taken. This kind of error is called bias . Errors [ change | change source ] We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample, and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly. However, sometimes large random samples are hard to take. And bias can happen if different people are not asked, or refuse to answer our questions, or if they know they are getting a fake treatment. These problems can be hard to fix. See standard error for more. Descriptive statistics [ change | change source ] Finding one value to act in place of multiple data values [ change | change source ] Often, people find it easier to decrease the numbers that make up a set of data and work with a single number instead; many people think that the best number to choose is a number in the middle of the data (a \"typical\" value of the population). This number in the middle of the data is called its central tendency . There are three kinds of central tendencies that are often used: the mean (sometimes called the average), the median and the mode . The examples below use this sample data: Name A B C D E F G H I J Score 23 26 49 49 57 64 66 78 82 92 Mean [ change | change source ] The formula for the commonly used mean (the so-called \"arithmetic mean\") is [ 18 ] x ¯ = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N x i = x 1 + x 2 + ⋯ + x N N {\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}={\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}x_{i}={\\frac {x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots +x_{N}}{N}}} Where x 1 , x 2 , … , x N {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{N}} are the data and N {\\displaystyle N} is the population size (see also Sigma Notation ). This means that one calculates the mean by adding up all the values , and then divide by the number of values. For the example above, the mean is: x ¯ = ( 23 + 26 + 49 + 49 + 57 + 64 + 66 + 78 + 82 + 92 ) / 10 = 58.6 {\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}=(23+26+49+49+57+64+66+78+82+92)/10=58.6} The problem with the mean is that it is affected by very large or very small values. In statistics, these extreme values might be errors of measurement, but sometimes the population really does contain these values. If a set of data has one of these values, then the mean may not be similar to most or all of the original values. For example, if there are 10 people in a room who make $10 per day and 1 who makes $1,000,000 per day, then the mean of the data is $90,918 per day. The average also does not work if a set of data includes multiple groups that are much different that each other. In a room of 10 people with five people who make $10 and five people who make $100 per day, the average of these data is $55 per day. In both cases, the mean is not the amount any single person makes; this fact makes the mean not very useful for some purposes. Other kinds of means exist, like the geometric mean ; other means are useful for other purposes. Median [ change | change source ] The median is the middle item of the data. For a given data X {\\displaystyle X} , this is sometimes written as X ~ {\\displaystyle {\\widetilde {X}}} . [ 18 ] To find the median, we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number, and then choose the number in the middle. If there is an even number of data, there will not be a number right in the middle, so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean. In our example above, there are 10 items of data, the two middle ones are \"57\" and \"64\", so the median is (57+64)/2 = 60.5. As another example, like the income example presented for the mean, consider a room with 10 people who have incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000. Here, the median is $55, because $55 is the average of the two middle numbers, $50 and $60.  If the extreme value of $1,000,000 is ignored, the mean is $53.  In this case, the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out.  The median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the first example in the definition of mean above. However, the median still does not work as well for data made of multiple groups. In a room of 10 people with five people who make $10 and five people who make $100 per day, the median of these data is still $55 per day, which is still not similar to most of the people in the room. Mode [ change | change source ] The mode is the most frequent item of data. For example, if there are 10 people in a room with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, then the mode is $90, because $90 occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times. There can be more than one mode. For example, if there are 10 people in a room with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $20, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, the modes are $20 and $90. This is bi-modal, or has two modes. Bi-modality is very common, and it often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups.  For instance, the average height of all adults in the U.S. has a bi-modal distribution.  This is because males and females have separate average heights of 1.763 m (5 ft 9 + 1⁄2 in) for men and 1.622 m (5 ft 4 in) for women.  These peaks are apparent when both groups are combined. The mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order. Finding the spread of the data [ change | change source ] Another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is. A common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation . If the standard deviation of a set of data is small, then most of the data is very close to the average. If the standard deviation is large, though, then a lot of the data is very different from the average. The standard deviation of a sample is generally different from the standard deviation of its originating population . Because of that, we write σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } for population standard deviation, and s {\\displaystyle s} for sample standard deviation. [ 18 ] If the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution , then it is very useful to know the standard deviation. If the data follows this pattern (we would say the data is normally distributed ), about 68 of every 100 pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation. Not only that, but about 95 of every 100 measurements will be off the average by less than two times the standard deviation, and about 997 in 1000 will be closer to the average by less than three standard deviations. Other descriptive statistics [ change | change source ] We also can use statistics to find out that some percent , percentile , number , or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category . For example, social scientists used statistics to find out that 49% of people in the world are males .

Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use (\"Terms of Use\"). Overview These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with rare exceptions, such as under policies like these Terms of Use, for legal compliance, or when faced with urgent threats of serious harm). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content. The community – the network of users who are constantly building and using the Projects and/or their websites (hereby referred to as \"Project Websites\") – is the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our Projects and Project Websites. The community also undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multilingual edition). You, the user, are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions, including the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC), which apply to all Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Since we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, content you contribute is made available under a free license or released in the public domain. Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and reuse of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include laws where you or the subject of your contributions are located). This means it is important that you exercise caution when posting, modifying or reusing content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot do, most of which are either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of an appropriate professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety. For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation. Unless otherwise stated by the Foundation as an authorized party on a given Project's Website, those other organizations have no responsibility for the operations of the Project's Website or its content. 1. Our Services The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development, and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here . However, we act only as a hosting service provider, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework. This infrastructure and framework allow our users to build the Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. They also allow our users to reuse that content. The infrastructure we maintain includes specialized technological infrastructure that enables users to programmatically interact with and reuse content on Projects (referred to as \"Application Programming Interface\" or \"APIs\"), and mobile applications. As used throughout the rest of the Terms of Use, our services consist of: The Project Websites we host , technological infrastructure that we maintain, and any technical spaces that we host for the maintenance and improvement of our Projects. Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and other users: We do not take an editorial role: Because the Projects are collaboratively edited, the vast majority of the content that we host is provided by users, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project Websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, unless we have expressly stated otherwise, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content on the Projects. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on the Projects, your reuse of content on the Projects, your use of the APIs, and your use of our services more generally. For your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid taking any actions that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. For other countries, this is determined on a case-by-case basis. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn users—particularly the editors, contributors, and authors—that non-U.S. authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. We generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification against the application of such laws. 2. Privacy Policy We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy , so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information. 3. Content We Host You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we host a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services. The Projects' content is for general informational purposes only: Although our Projects host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project Websites. 4. Refraining from Certain Activities The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project. We ask that all users review and follow the Universal Code of Conduct (\"UCoC\"), which lays out requirements for collegial, civil collaboration across all Projects that we host. Certain activities, whether legal or illegal under the applicable law, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on, or otherwise using, our Projects. These activities include: Harassing and Abusing Others Engaging in threats, stalking, spamming, vandalism, or harassment as described in the UCoC; Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users; Posting or modifying content with the intention to seriously harm others, such as deliberate inducements to self-harm, or deliberate triggering of epilepsy. Violating the Privacy of Others Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content); Soliciting personally identifiable information for the purposes of harassment, exploitation, or violation of privacy, or for any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 years, or under the age of majority where you are if higher than 18 years, for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors. Engaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation under the laws of the United States of America; Posting or modifying content with the intent to deceive or mislead others; Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, hiding your affiliation with any individual or entity when disclosure is required by these terms or local Project policy, or using the name or username of another person with the intent to deceive; and Engaging in fraud. Committing Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under the applicable law. Misusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography or child sexual abuse material, or encouraging, grooming, or advocating for others to create or share such material; Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law. Engaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of other users; Engaging in automated uses of the Project Websites that are abusive or disruptive of the services, violate acceptable usage policies where available, or have not been approved by the Wikimedia community; Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on an API, Project Website or the networks or servers connected with a particular Project Website; Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project Websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose; Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met: such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks; such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work); you report any vulnerabilities to the relevant developers (or fix it yourself); and you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent. Shortcut : PAID Paid Contributions Without Disclosure You must disclose each and any employer, client, intended beneficiary and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways: a statement on your user page, a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions. In addition, if you make a public posting off the Projects advertising editing services on Wikipedia in exchange for compensation of any kind, you must disclose all Wikipedia accounts you have used or will use for this service in the public posting on the third-party service. Applicable law, or Project-specific policies and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure. For example, infringing Wikimedia Trademarks (defined hereinafter at Section 6) to advertise paid editing services, removing disclosures on previously adequately disclosed paid edits, or logged-out paid editing in a manner that makes adequate disclosure a practical impossibility violate this section. A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy which may supplement or replace this section. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section (titled \"Paid Contributions Without Disclosure\") when contributing to that particular Project. For more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions . We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the provisions in section 4 of these Terms of Use. Where required, enforcement of these terms may include actions not listed in the Wikimedia Foundation Office Action Policy . If enforcement is required in new circumstances, we will make an effort within at most one (1) year to update the Office Action Policy to catalog the new type of action. Marketing Company Mediations Undisclosed editing by users receiving compensation creates an unreasonable burden on volunteer editors who investigate and enforce community policies . Therefore, for violations of this section related to undisclosed paid editing, you agree to submit to binding \"Med-Arb\" (a \"Marketing Company Mediation\") as described in section 14 of these Terms of Use. 5. Password Security You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and other security credentials, and should never disclose them to any third party. 6. Trademarks Although you have considerable freedoms for reuse of the content on the Project Websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy . 7. Licensing of Content To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects or Project Websites are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to redistribute and reuse their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to reuse and redistribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who may access it. You agree to the following licensing requirements: Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (\"CC BY-SA 4.0\"), and GNU Free Documentation License (\"GFDL\") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Reusers may comply with either license or both. The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under the particular license prescribed by the Project edition or the feature.\n\nPlease note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms of the respective licenses. Where you own Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA 4.0, you waive these rights. As an example, this means facts you contribute to the projects may be reused freely without attribution. Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the relevant license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you represent and warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with CC BY-SA (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature). For a list of compatible licenses, see Creative Commons . You shall not import content that is available solely under GFDL. You agree that, if you import text under a CC license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason. Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted reuse and redistribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy , and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to Wikimedia Commons. No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services. Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome. It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately. Re-use: Reuse of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under \"fair use\" or similar exemptions under applicable copyright law. Any reuse must comply with the underlying license(s). When you reuse or redistribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in \"Importing text,\" above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page. In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear, for example, in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, reusers should preserve them. For any non-text media, you agree to comply with the applicable license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When reusing any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses. Modifications or additions to material that you reuse: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project Website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 4.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature). When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available. With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are reusing text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself. 8. DMCA Compliance The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be reused by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers on our Projects and services. However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Lumen Database website. If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed by filing a notice under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legal wikimedia org or snail mail our designated agent . Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than the process prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, visit the Copyright Problems page . Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at info wikimedia org . 9. Third-party Websites and Resources You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects and Project Websites contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content. 10. Management of Websites The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement. It is possible to notify us of illegal content, or content that violates our Terms of Use (including all policies and other documents incorporated by reference) for other reasons by contacting us directly . However, you can typically make a request directly to the Project's community: this may be more efficient, and is more consistent with our Projects' aim to empower the user community. Each Project will usually provide \"Help\" or \"Contact\" pages for further guidance, or specific tools for reporting issues. Alternatively – if in doubt – you can ask members of the community for help, by sending an email to info wikimedia org or a more language-specific address from the Volunteer Response Team page . Please note that these mailboxes are monitored by users of the Projects, not the Foundation. As a result, they should not be threatened or issued with legal demands. If you contact the Foundation with a problem, we will typically explore whether and how existing community-led mechanisms can investigate and, where appropriate, resolve it. In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user or especially problematic content because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion (or where legally compelled), to: Investigate your use of the Projects or our services (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or an appropriate governmental request; Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, false or unverifiable information, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests; Refuse, revert, disable, or restrict access to contributions of any user who violates these Terms of Use; Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat posting of unlawful material under applicable law in line with human rights principles; Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public. Those Foundation moderation activities may be informed or performed by software (such as traffic flood (\"Denial of Service\") protection). In those cases human review is normally available, upon request . In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had their account or access blocked under this section, they are prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, the Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies. The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition. Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy . In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures. The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms of Use. If you believe we have not satisfactorily acted on a problematic content report, or if you have been subjected to a Foundation moderation action that you wish to challenge, you may be able to submit an appeal .  Other information about routes of appeal may also be explained to you at the time, or in Project-specific help pages. We reserve the right to suspend (temporarily, or permanently) our handling of reports or other correspondence from users or third parties, whether about allegedly illegal or otherwise problematic content or conduct, or requesting appeals against moderation actions, if such correspondence was made in bad faith, repetitive, unfounded, and/or abusive. In appropriate circumstances, your email address may even be blocked on our email system(s), and you will then need to contact us at our postal address if you wish to further correspond with us during that block. For less serious cases (e.g. up to three polite emails about one or more meritless complaints), this is likely to be temporary. More frequent or more abusive communications are more likely to lead to permanent measures. 11. Resolutions and Project Policies The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable. 12. API Terms We make available a set of APIs, which include documentation and associated tools, to enable users to build products that promote free knowledge. By using our APIs, you agree to abide by all applicable policies governing the use of the APIs, which include but are not limited to the User-Agent Policy , the Robot Policy , and the API:Etiquette (collectively, \"API Documentation\"), which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference. 13. Termination Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions and a record of your activities on or in relation to the Projects (including any correspondence you have sent us) will be unaffected (subject to applicable policies), and you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. However, regardless of any other provision in these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-16, and 18. 14. Disputes and Jurisdiction Highlighted for emphasis We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use. To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred). Marketing Company Mediations As described in section 4 of these Terms of Use, you agree to resolve violations of the Paid Contributions without Disclosure in a Marketing Company Mediation at the Foundation's discretion. Marketing Company Mediations are binding mediations where, at the end of either a half or full day session, any disputed items that remain unresolved will be decided by the mediator in a legally binding decision. They will be conducted in meetings by teleconference or videoconference. If an in-person meeting is required, then the Marketing Company Mediation will take place in San Francisco County, California. The parties will split all fees and expenses related to the mediation/arbitration equally. You agree, as part of a Marketing Company Mediation, to cooperate with the Foundation, including by timely providing any documentation in your possession relating to your undisclosed paid editing activities including the accounts used, articles affected, and clients who purchased such services. Marketing Company Mediations are subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act to the extent that the mediator becomes an arbitrator. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees (including all fees necessary to determine the applicability of the Marketing Company Mediation and to enforce the binding result) and all costs relating to the investigation and enforcement of its rights. A party may be deemed \"prevailing\" even if it is not successful on every claim asserted. If for some reason the entirety of these Marketing Company Mediation requirements are found to be unenforceable, you agree to resolve any disputes as described in the beginning of this section. 15. Disclaimers Highlighted for emphasis At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure. We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice. Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law. 16. Limitation on Liability Highlighted for emphasis The Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (US$1,000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 17. Modifications to these Terms of Use Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice. Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-l . However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services. 18. Other Terms These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, joint control or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation.

The table below, however, excludes 13 Wikipedias that were closed and moved to the Wikimedia Incubator for further development, leaving a current total of 339 active Wikipedias. Content in other languages is being developed at the Wikimedia Incubator; languages which meet certain criteria can get their own wikis . The table entries are ordered by current article count. Each entry gives the language name in English (linked to the English Wikipedia article for the language); its \"local name\" (i.e. in the language itself, linked to the article in that language's wiki); the language code used in the wiki's URL address and in interwiki links to it (linked to the local Main Page); and statistics on articles, edits, administrators, users, active users, and images (each linked to an appropriate local special page). To start a Wikipedia in a new language, please see our language proposal policy and the Incubator manual . Note: Just adding a link here does not create a new Wikipedia, nor does it serve to request that one be created. If a wiki becomes active and is not listed here, please post a notice on this article's talk page , including a link to all the relevant Wikipedia pages, and help promote the effort by announcing it on the Wikipedia-L mailing list, and at Wikimedia News . The tables here are maintained automatically based on statistics collected by a bot four times a day, so it is not necessary to \"manually\" update the table. (The way this is being done makes that impossible, anyway.) If something is wrong with an entry other than simply having slightly outdated statistics, post about it on the talk page . More lists of Wikipedias by various criteria : [ edit ] List of Wikipedias by article count , users , file count and depth and its source (both updated every 6 hours) List of Wikipedias by edits per article and depth (both updated every 6 hours) List of Wikipedias by language group and family (both updated every 6 hours) and language families as a tree (not just Wikipedias) List of Wikipedias by country (updated manually) List of Wikipedias by speakers per article (updated every 6 hours) List of Wikipedias by sample of articles and expanded sample of articles (both updated monthly) List of Wikipedias by featured and good articles (both updated manually) List of Wikipedias by creation date (incomplete) List of Wikipedias in multiple writing systems List of Wikipedias having local media files and zero local media files (both updated manually) List of Wikipedia milestones or en:Wikipedia:Milestone statistics (tracking of major article-count milestones) List of largest wikis (not just Wikimedia wikis) Wikimedia News (announcements and tracking of milestones for all Wikimedia projects) Tell us about your Wikipedia Notes The \" All pages \" column refers to the number of pages in all namespaces, including both articles (the official article count of each wiki) and non-articles (user pages, images, talk pages, \"project\" pages, categories, and templates). \" Active Users \" are registered users who have made at least one edit in the last thirty days. \" Files \" is the number of locally uploaded files. Note that some large Wikipedias do not use local images or other media files and rely on Commons completely, so the value \"0\" is not a glitch (see also List of Wikipedias having zero local media files ). All Wikipedias ordered by number of articles The languages listed here are Wikipedias that have been created as separate subdomains of wikipedia.org, ordered by number of articles . The table can also be sorted by other columns. It excludes closed Wikipedias . Historical data of this table dating back to 2007 can be found in the history of this table (or, after 15 October 2022, in the history of the current source of the data ). These statistics are updated nine times a day. See commons:Data:Wikipedia statistics/data.tab for the date/time of last update. (If reloading this page doesn't update the numbers to what is seen at Commons, try purging the cache .) № Language Language (local) Wiki Articles All pages Edits Admins Users Active users Files Depth

See the Incubator Manual and FAQ for more information. Manually maintained list of test Wikipedias in the Incubator Search for a wiki in over 400 different languages (includes normal Wikipedias and test Wikipedias) Closed and read-only These Wikipedias are closed and in read-only status. Existing users can still log in and their user preferences are still effective, but they cannot edit any pages. Editiable copies of these Wikipedias can be found in the Incubator; for example, the page cho:Chahta at the closed Choctaw Wikipedia can be found (and edited) at incubator:Wp/cho/Chahta . aa: – The Afar Wikipedia was closed on 10 May 2008 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/aa . ak: – The Akan Wikipedia was closed on 1 April 2023 . It should be noted that Akan is now considered a family of languages, so the ak.wikipedia domain has been split into two separate projects (and potentially more): one for Twi at tw: , and another for Fante at fat: . cho: – The Choctaw Wikipedia was closed on 3 July 2007 , following a community vote. It is now found at incubator:Wp/cho . ho: – The Hiri Motu Wikipedia was closed on 9 July 2007 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/ho . hz: – The Herero Wikipedia was closed on 24 July 2007 . The wiki has been emptied and locked, but the original user pages still exist. It is now found at incubator:Wp/hz . ii: – The Yi Wikipedia was closed on 29 July 2007 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/ii . kj: – The Kwanyama Wikipedia was closed on 10 July 2007 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/kj . kr: – The Kanuri Wikipedia was closed on 3 May 2007 , following a community vote. The reason was the absence of both content and community. It is now found at incubator:Wp/kr . lrc: – The Northern Luri Wikipedia was closed on 14 January 2021 . As almost all of the former contents were confirmed not written in proper Luri, they were not imported back into the Incubator. Users who speak the language are encouraged to re-start a test project . mh: – The Marshallese Wikipedia was closed on 4 May 2008 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/mh . mus: – The Muscogee Wikipedia was closed on 10 July 2007 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/mus . na: – The Nauruan Wikipedia was closed on 1 May 2023 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/na . ng: – The Ndonga Wikipedia was closed on 10 January 2010 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/ng . See also our Special:SiteMatrix , where the closed Wikipedias are crossed out (and the red links indicate wikis that have never existed). There is also a configuration file listing all closed Wikimedia projects . Deleted but hosted elsewhere These Wikipedias are no longer hosted by Wikimedia. They have been moved to other hosts. tok: – The Toki Pona Wikipedia was officially closed in 2008 and all projects in that language were deleted in 2010 due to the lack of a valid ISO language code at the time. The wiki was hosted by Wikia (which became Fandom ) until 2021. It is now an independently hosted encyclopedia at https://wikipesija.org . tlh: – The Klingon Wikipedia was permanently locked in August 2005, and was moved to Wikia (Fandom) as the Klingon Wiki . For details, see the history of the Klingon Wikipedia . ru-sib: – The Siberian Wikipedia was deleted in 2007 after it became apparent that the creation of the wiki in 2006 was based on a hoax. The wiki's content was moved to the sibvolgota ( archive link ). mo: – The Moldovan Wikipedia in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet was deleted in November 2017 , a decade after being closed . It is now hosted by Fandom as Википедия . The mo: interlanguage prefix now points to the Romanian Wikipedia. Nonstandard language codes These Wikipedias use language codes that do not conform to the ISO 639 standard (which is how wiki subdomains are chosen nowadays). als: – originally used for the Alsatian Wikipedia, which now encompasses the Alemannic dialects in general — the official code gsw is being considered as a replacement subdomain (note that als officially represents the unrelated language Tosk Albanian ) bat-smg: – invented code used for the Samogitian Wikipedia (not the official code sgs ) be-tarask: – invented code used for the Belarusian (Taraškievica) Wikipedia, combination of be for Belarusian and IETF language tag tarask for Taraškievica cbk-zam: – invented code used for the Zamboanga Chavacano Wikipedia (note that cbk is the correct code for the larger family of langugages Zamboanga Chavacano is a member of) fiu-vro: – invented code used for the Võro Wikipedia (not the official code vro — note that fiu is the official code for the family of languages Võro is a member of) ksh: – code used for the Ripuarian Wikipedia, even though ksh actually represents Kölsch (or Colognian) , a subset of Ripuarian map-bms: – invented code used for the Banyumasan Wikipedia (note that map does represent the family of languages the Banyumasan dialect falls within) nds-nl: – invented code used for Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia would technically be the correct code for Low Saxon spoken in the Netherlands (i.e., nds-NL ), but is therefore redundant with nds: , the code used for the Low German/Low Saxon Wikipedia (note that nds is the correct code for the Low German/Low Saxon family of languages, which Dutch Low Saxon is a member of) nrm: – code used for the Norman Wikipedia (not the official code nrf — note that nrm is the official code for the completely unrelated language Narom ) roa-rup: – invented code used for the Aromanian Wikipedia (not the official code rup — note that roa is the standard code for the larger family of Romance languages that Aromanian is a member of) roa-tara: – invented code used for the Tarantino Wikipedia (again, roa is the standard code for the large family of Romance languages that the Tarantino dialect falls within) sh: – deprecated code used for the Serbo-Croatian Wikipedia (not the official code hbs ) simple: – invented code used for the Simple English Wikipedia (which is just an IETF language tag, not the formal code en-simple ) zh-classical: – invented code used for the Classical Chinese Wikipedia (not the official code lzh ) zh-min-nan: – invented code used for the Southern Min Wikipedia (not the official code nan ) zh-yue: – invented code used for the Cantonese Wikipedia (not the official code yue ) Note that renaming wiki subdomains is very difficult , which is why so many of these nonstandard codes are still in use despite the existence of alternatives. Redirects be-x-old: – redirects to be-tarask: (see above section) cz: – redirects to cs: (the Czech Wikipedia) dk: – redirects to da: (the Danish Wikipedia) jp: – redirects to ja: (the Japanese Wikipedia) mo: – redirects to ro: (as discussed above , the Moldovan Wikipedia now redirects to the Romanian Wikipedia) nan: – redirects to zh-min-nan: (the Southern Min Wikipedia) nb: – redirects to no: (the Norwegian Wikipedia using Bokmål orthography ) yue: – redirects to zh-yue: (the Cantonese Wikipedia) Non-language subdomains nostalgia: – A read-only snapshot of Wikipedia's early days. sep11: – The Sep11wiki existed with a .wikipedia.org URL from 2001 to 2008, despite its totally different scope and purpose from all other Wikipedias. It was made read-only in 2006 and closed two years later. ten: – Used for Wikipedia 10 , the 10th anniversary of Wikipedia celebration events. (Since \" ten \" is an ISO language code for the extinct Tama language in Colombia , the interwiki prefix \" tenwiki: \" is now used to refer to this site.)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Welcome to Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit . 6,899,904 articles in English From today's featured article Wells Cathedral is an Anglican place of worship in Wells, Somerset , dedicated to Andrew the Apostle . It is the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells , whose cathedra it holds as mother church of the Diocese of Bath and Wells . Built as a Roman Catholic cathedral from around 1175 to replace an earlier church on the site since 705, it became an Anglican cathedral when Henry VIII split from Rome. Its Gothic architecture is mostly inspired from Early English style of the late 12th to early 13th centuries. The stonework of its pointed arcades and fluted piers bears pronounced mouldings and carved capitals in a foliate, \"stiff-leaf\" style. The east end retains much ancient stained glass . Unlike many cathedrals of monastic foundation, Wells has many surviving secular buildings linked to its chapter of secular canons , including the Bishop's Palace and the 15th-century residential Vicars' Close . It is a Grade I listed building .

It is found in Europe and Asia Minor, as far east as the Caspian Sea , and resides close to water bodies containing plants with a flight season running from May to July. The hairy dragonfly is named for its hairy thorax , distinguishing it from other hawkers. With a typical length of around 5.5 centimetres (2.2 in), it has a long, narrow pterostigma and features coupled, oval-shaped markings on its abdomen, blue on males and yellow on females. This male hairy dragonfly on a fern was photographed in Burren National Park , County Clare, Ireland. Photograph credit: Charles J.

Distinguished author Mary Agnes Chase 1869–1963. Standard IPNI form: Chase Mary Agnes Chase, née Merrill, was an American botanist who worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution. She is considered one of the world's outstanding agrostologists and is known for her work on the study of grasses, and also for her work as a suffragist. Chase was born in Iroquois County, Illinois and held no formal education beyond grammar school. That aside, she made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois. She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North- as well as and South America. Her Smithsonian Field Books collection from 1897 to 1959 is archived in the Smithsonian Institution Archives. In 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the Field Museum of Natural History under Charles Frederick Millspaugh , where her work was featured in two museum publications: Plantae Utowanae (1900) and Plantae Yucatanae (1904). Two years later, Chase joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a botanical illustrator and eventually became a scientific assistant in systematic agrostology (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under Albert Spear Hitchcock . Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing, for instance The North American Species of Panicum (1910). Following Hitchcock's death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the United States National Museum (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939, but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963. She was an Honorary Fellow of the Smithsonian Institution (1959) and Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (1961). Agnesia is named in her honour (a monotypic genus of herbaceous South American bamboo in the grass family). Chase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition's benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men. During World War I, Chase marched with Alice Paul and was jailed several times for her activities. In 1918, she was arrested at the Silent Sentinels rally picketing the White House; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed. The USDA accused her of \"conduct unbecoming a government employee,\" but Hitchcock helped her keep her job. Chase was also an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). See also: Distinguished authors of previous months . Species of the month Five-horned Beetle Eupatorus gracilicornis Some facts about this beetle: Length : 50–95 mm. Larva diet : Rotten wood. Adult diet : Nectar, plant sap and fruit. Range : Southeast Asia. First described : By the British entomologist Gilbert John Arrow in 1908. A rhinoceros with five horns? Well, Eupatorus gracilicornis is not quite a rhinoceros but nevertheless it is a fascinating creature. This extravagant beetle is boldly colored with shiny jet-black while the elytra or fore wings are colored yellow or gold. It has four large horns on the pronotum (the foremost thorax segment) and one extra-long cephalic (of the head) horn. The body is covered by a thick exoskeleton and a pair of thick wings lie atop another set of membranous wings underneath, allowing the beetle to fly, although not very efficiently, owing to its large size. The flying season is usually in September, when most of the males usually appear to wait for copulation.

Znany głównie ze swojej roli w ekspedycjach morskich na północ. Zajmuje poczesne miejsce w mormońskiej teologii, szczególnie w kontekście związków Kościoła z Polinezyjczykami. Postać Hagota, stanowiąca integralną część szerszej kultury mormońskiej, pojawia się również w dociekaniach apologetów tej tradycji religijnej, usiłujących dowieść autentyczności Księgi Mormona . Wzmianki o nim zawiera 63. rozdział Księgi Almy , wchodzącej w skład tej właśnie części mormońskiego kanonu pism świętych. Istnienie Hagota, a także związane z nim hipotezy nie znalazły potwierdzenia w źródłach zewnętrznych. Utrwalony w sztuce. Znalazł się wśród postaci ujętych na płaskorzeźbach zdobiących świątynię mormońską w hawajskim Lāʻie . Stoi na nim na prawo od Jezusa Chrystusa , obok okrętu, trzyma też w ręku wiosło.

Dobry artykuł Lista występów Sarah Bernhardt –  w trwającej ponad 60 lat karierze Sarah Bernhardt występowała na scenie i w filmach. Zagrała w przeszło 160 sztukach oraz 8 produkcjach fabularnych . Uznawana jest za jedną z najwybitniejszych aktorek w historii teatru , legendę, największą tragiczkę i najbardziej znaną kobietę swoich czasów, a także pionierkę kina. Pierwszą styczność ze sceną miała w latach nauki w szkole w Neuilly-Auteuil-Passy, gdzie wystąpiła w amatorskim przedstawieniu Klotylda , portretując Królową Wróżek. Karierę sceniczną rozpoczęła na początku lat 60. XIX wieku, występując w Comédie-Française . Pierwszym sukcesem i przełomem w jej karierze były występy w tragedii Atalia z 1867 roku. Status gwiazdy zyskała główną kreacją w dramacie romantycznym Ruy Blas . Była jedną z pierwszych aktorek, która zagrała w filmie – Pojedynek Hamleta z 1900 roku. Zrewolucjonizowała styl gry, odrzucając powszechnie stosowaną przez uczelnie i teatry tradycję na rzecz naturalności. Czytaj więcej… Inne Dobre Artykuły • Jak pisać w stylu encyklopedycznym?

Above, we had a discussion to change the settings for the archiving of this page, without realizing this page (and namespace) was purposefully excluded by the operator due to policy on requiring consensus for any public page that is outside the above named \"namespaces.\" The current settings for this page archiving is as follows: Archive any discussion that has not been edited in the last 45 days (using the last time stamp in the discussion) Must leave the last three (3) discussions (regardless of how old) on the page.

Neptune On the front page as of now, the picture is different. I've seen this happen before, but I was ignored. In the article, they use a completely different picture rather than the one of the front page. LOLHWAT ( talk ) 11:42, 16 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ LOLHWAT I believe it picks a random picture from the article. Thanks, and be well! - PDL Talk to me! Please don't eat da 🐑! 11:50, 17 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ PotsdamLamb and LOLHWAT : The article previews on the main page come from subpages of Wikipedia:Very good articles . For example, this one is at Wikipedia:Very good articles/Neptune . These do not update automatically so they have to be updated by a person, when the article is changed. About the picture of Neptune: I liked the one on the front page better, but sadly, it's a false color image, so we should probably update it to use the true color image that's displayed on Neptune . Kk.urban ( talk ) 19:21, 17 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] English: Uploader's notes: The original NASA/Cowart PNG image has been modified by flattening (combining layers), cropping and converting to JPEG format. Original caption released with image: Voyager 2 Narrow Angle Camera image of Neptune taken on August 20, 1989 as the spacecraft approached the planet for a flyby on August 25. The Great Dark Spot, flanked by cirrus clouds, is at center. A smaller dark storm, Dark Spot Jr., is rotating into view at bottom left. Additionally, a patch of white cirrus clouds to its north, named \"Scooter\" for its rapid motion relative to other features, is visible. This image was constructed using orange, green and synthetic violet (50/50 blend of green filter and UV filter images) taken between 626 and 643 UT.

LOLHWAT ( talk ) 22:03, 17 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Inquiry How many articles are there in Simple Wikipedia? Brick No.2 ( talk ) 06:08, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Special:Statistics says there are slighlty more than 254.000 \"content pages\". I guess that includes the \"Wikipedia:\" namespace, which is mostly about coordinating the project. There are likely less than 50 pages there, so it doesn't really influence the count. Eptalon ( talk ) 07:02, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Why did you add the decimal point? Or was it a typo (meaning the number would be 254 000 Brick No.2 ( talk ) 09:05, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] The thousands separator is either a full stop (.), a comma (,) or a space. Eptalon ( talk ) 09:11, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Is that a foreign thing or something? In Australia the full stop isn't used to separate thousands - or at least I don't think so.

It varies by counrty.-- Eptalon ( talk ) 07:56, 1 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Best way to use a fair use non free EN wiki file here? Trying to update a article the  English wiki has one but its fair use and tried using it here and it did not work and could not find a way to upload other than commons but they do not accept non free files what is the best way is it to link to URL of the the EN wiki file  or link to the URL official image? Commons does not have a similar file. Isla ( talk ) 11:54, 25 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ Isla : At this time, it is not possible to do that. As it happens, there is a current discussion about this at Wikipedia:Simple_talk#Non-free_images . By the way, please use WP:Simple talk for questions like this. The page we're on is for discussing the main page. Thanks. -- Auntof6 ( talk ) 04:38, 26 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Unfortunately there is no such way because Simple is still stuck in 2004. – Davey 2010 Talk 14:18, 26 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Removal/change of Wikispecies URL The species:Main Page (Simple English) page that the Wikispecies URL redirects to has been deleted over at Wikispecies for the reason, Per similar other multilingual projects, there is no need for an explicitly simple English page here. It may be appropriate to move it down to \"In Regular English:\" and point the URL at species:Main Page ? Ternera ( talk ) 16:03, 25 September 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I've pointed the URL to species:Main Page , I haven't moved it for now as I think (not 100% certain) it's referring to the project in general. For example, Wikidata is on there even though it doesn't have a Simple English specific Main Page. Looking at some random Wikispecies pages, I believe they are reasonably simple for our readers to understand. -- Ferien ( talk ) 16:22, 25 September 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Retrieved from \" https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page&oldid=9816698 \" Hidden categories: Wikipedia semi-protected talk pages Pages using Template:Annual readership This page was last changed on 9 October 2024, at 05:30.

Add this page to your list of watched pages — Purge change Country-musicians *raised* in 'a state of the United States' [ change source ] There were some \"List of country musicians from 'state in the United States']], that were deleted some years ago.--Those, and List of country musicians from California , have little interest, to me. (\"Never-ending\" discussions about the meaning of 'from', is not my cup of tea.) However, List of country musicians raised in Texas , is a list that i might start.--If a person was raised in two or more states, then I am fine with just having that person in \"Related pages\", or (much less likely) section \"Raised in different states\". List of country musicians from California , has some names that 'could end up on two lists'.--However, I am not planning on starting, \"List of country musicians raised in California\".--Is there anything more to say then, except: if there are too many protests about \"my\" list, then it will get taken to AfD?--Remember also to give thanks to those who do a lot of work with categories. 2001:2020:341:DA4B:F071:D4FE:8575:D928 ( talk ) 23:01, 25 September 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Kris Kristofferson (d. 2024), has 'always' been on the 'California list' (because he was raised there).--When any 'Texas list' gets created - then how does one avoid him being 'Listed on two similar lists'? The following could be mentioned on 'the (upcoming) Texas list', \"* Kris Kristoffersen [not blue-linked]\" ,see List of country musicians raised in California \" In that way, Kristoffersen 'is only on one list (California)' (and the few people that know that Kristoffersen was born in Texas, will find his name, and see which 'one list that Kristoffersen really belongs to'. Note: there is no list here called, \"List of ... born in California\"). \" Raised in California\", is part of topic \" From Californa\". (Would anyone argue \"No\", to that point?) 2001:2020:355:C958:1431:DC72:A783:3460 ( talk ) 02:40, 1 October 2024 (UTC) / 02:35, 1 October 2024 (UTC) /2001:2020:341:DA4B:F071:D4FE:8575:D928 [ reply ] List of country musicians from Texas .

No need for an extra classification. Eptalon ( talk ) 21:07, 12 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] List of country musicians from Texas , seems to not have \"your\" concerns/problems.--If you think that the article should be deleted, then you might want to nominate it for Delete.--If you have an example of anyone who is on the wrong list, then i suggest that you take up the matter on the talk page of 'musicians from that state'.--One person should only be linked from one list (and I can not see any problem yet, now that Kristoffersen seems to 'be on only one page'). 2001:2020:341:B0D8:49A7:52CE:A985:441A ( talk ) 04:48, 13 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I don't see any benefits to change things to other than there are now. fr33k man 06:03, 13 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] It would be a benifit that we get things right, in regard to cases such as this composer of Take It Easy , so that they do not get passed off as a European country-musician (or German, since he was born there, but raised in California).--En-wiki has gotten the category right, i feel.--The way that (relevant) articles, are today - seems largely okay.--Time to let this thread, Just Fade Away . 2001:2020:333:C6E5:83A:C472:2680:1408 ( talk ) 19:55, 18 October 2024 (UTC) /2001:2020:341:B0D8:49A7:52CE:A985:441A [ reply ] I think the question should also be, if it is practical: Yes, most people were born elsewhee, and raisen somewhere. The big question thouigh, is: What do we lose, if we classify thse people as \"People from ...\"?

I would therefore propose we set up the bot to also archive them automatically; proposed parameters: 10d old, min 2 threads left. Comments? Eptalon ( talk ) 08:25, 6 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Related previous discussion can be seen at Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_checkuser#Archiving . MathXplore ( talk ) 00:32, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Considering how RfCU works, I would want to see the bot be tested in a RfCU replica before firmly saying yay or nay.- FusionSub ( Talk page ) ( Contributions ) 10:28, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Pure Evil offered a reasonable point at Wikipedia talk:Requests for checkuser#Archiving 2 . I feel like it is probably best for CUs to manually review each one prior to it going to the archived, as responses can often go unanswered - and I appreciate sometimes this is on purpose. -- Ferien ( talk ) 16:00, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Idk, I'm 50:50 on this one. It'd be nice to have them auto archived due to workload issues but understand the issues of wanting to manually close them out. I'd lean towards a bot if it could be made to work. fr33k man 18:42, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] i think the bot handling the other page archiving could be made to work. It would archive discussions that haven't Bern touched in ..  days, leaving at least ... Items on the page? Eptalon ( talk ) 19:48, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I would leave it to the people with the checkuser right to decide, but I have a question. Is there an amount of time an unaddressed request can be left, after which either it is considered stale or the checkusers wouldn't do anything with it? I would let that be the number of days old to use for archiving. -- Auntof6 ( talk ) 06:56, 10 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] ( Non-checkuser observation ) @ Auntof6 : m:CheckUser_policy#CheckUser_status says information is only stored for a short period (currently 90 days) , so I think this is the time limit. MathXplore ( talk ) 07:07, 10 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] As to the data availability: requests need to be made fairly quickly, information that is older than about three months is deleted. As you requests: I would guess s bot could (technically) handle archiving old requests.... Eptalon ( talk ) 23:04, 10 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] ┌─────────────────────────────────┘ I found C:User:SpBot/How to make SpBot archive your wiki that looks like it could help with this. A note on C:Commons talk:WikiProject Heraldry and vexillology , which the bot archives, says that it archives 1) any section tagged as resolved and 2) any section whose most recent comment is older than 90 days. Of course, maybe our usual archiving bot can do the same thing. -- Auntof6 ( talk ) 13:04, 11 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Template:Langx [ change source ] I was expanding features on {{ Langx }} .

Batrachoseps ( talk ) 18:44, 9 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I think we should match en and have it so tropical cyclone contains the main details, but they are also branched off into Atlantic hurricane and typhoon . Hurricane in its current state should be redirected to the tropical cyclone article, imo. -- Ferien ( talk ) 18:47, 9 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Templates for discussion [ change source ] I came across the following navbox templates that I would like a discussion on. Template:Clothing ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Crowns ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Hats ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Headgear ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Helmets ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Historical clothing ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) These templates: Have a large number of links, mostly red but some with a fair number of blue Are all clothing-related Are transcluded on one page (the historical clothing one) or no pages Except for the historical clothing one, were created by a user who appeared to be creating templates because they appeared in wanted templates. However, the only places that used them were lists of related templates on template doc pages. I was about to start adding these to the blue-linked pages, but I thought it was worth discussing first. The reason I am putting these up for discussion is that they would take up more space in an article than the article text on most of the articles that are blue-linked. Are we okay with having navboxes that overwhelm the body of an article? There are probably more templates with the same issue, but this is a small group of related ones that I happened to see around the same time. Please do not add these to articles until we have a chance to have this discussion, so that that we won't have to remove them again later.

No, i would be against that.--Remotely related: Would it be against wiki-regulations if I go to, say user talk:Aunty of 5,6,7 or to user talk:Epptalonn, and ask: Do you think this is an acceptable sub-stub about Golden hat (headwear) \"blah-blah-blah\".--Anyway, I would like to ask original poster which of the templates is the first one that she would 'recommend et cetera', that should be nominated for Delete.

Should the English Wikipedia link be used, or should it only be linked to this Wikipedia article, even if the article is missing here? Cosm Learner ( talk ) contribs 21:32, 11 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] There should not be that kind of link to any other Wikipedia. In fact, there shouldn't be links in an article's text to any other website. The link should be left red if there's nothing to link to here. See WP:ELPOINTS for the guideline. -- Auntof6 ( talk ) 23:01, 11 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] But you can use {{ ill }} to make a red link to simplewiki and a link to another wiki at the same time.

Bakhos Let's talk! 04:33, 12 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I think there are minimal length requirements, bit they are fluffy. VGAs need to be comprehensive, which likely means they end up at a certain length. Why don't you nominate the article when you think it is ready?

Close to 6000 community members from more than 180 wiki projects have voted. The following four candidates were the most voted: Christel Steigenberger Maciej Artur Nadzikiewicz Victoria Doronina Lorenzo Losa While these candidates have been ranked through the vote, they still need to be appointed to the Board of Trustees. They need to pass a successful background check and meet the qualifications outlined in the Bylaws. New trustees will be appointed at the next Board meeting in December 2024.

He's simply just abusing his power and removing all of my content specifically, and deleting massive amounts of information from the website. That's why I think he is wrong - Wikipedia is a place for information, and that means all of it. I will do my best to link the parts of my talk page where he has commented, both today and in the past (wherein he deleted massive amounts of content from the website). Any undo to his edits and he instantly reverts it, removing this content and giving the reason that it is 'nonsense' in his opinion. Here are the links I will try to paste where hopefully you can see that it is repetitive and targeted deletions: https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:W;ChangingUsername&action=edit&section=11 https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:W;ChangingUsername&action=edit&section=9 He doesn't or can't warn me 'as per' en:WP:DTTR in either because there's no grounds for it. He is only allowed because of his position, over me, which shouldn't matter in the context of putting information on this site. In another simple_talk entry, he deletes a ton of other content en-mass and throughout nearly all of the articles I have pasted from the NHS website to here. If this goes through then I will work on putting the pages back as I come across them (and I will hopefully be able to create more, so that simple_wikipedia is more full (which is what it should be about!) but (again) if this goes through then it would be probably best for someone with the ability to scan through mass content and correcting his actions to do it, because it is on a lot of the site throughout the content, and I believe it is vandalism. Tagging the user other so that he may be present: @ Davey2010 W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 15:26, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ Eptalon was my helper, I think. And I would like to point out that a majority of the pages I've created thus far have been categorized on the external wikilinks page, for simple_wikipedia, and that the information in the pages have been deleted, but previously would of been a link to this website with a more full page. And that way might be the only way for the person there to get it - but now, it is gone His contributions are Thomas the Tank Engine and Paw Patrol, and some really bad / low quality page on lymes disease and/or I think strokes, which didn't, and still don't ( because he reverts all edits done to the page ) in my opinion meet Wikipedias standards in a few ways. That and of course removing tons of content from the site. There is nothing wrong with the content on those pages, and here I am contesting - specifically or as an example - and would like to contest this decision of this 'insane' edit the page of course being Cinnarizine. There is NO content on this page anymore, after his edits - look at how many he cut out, and look at how much there is now. Does THIS still meet the standards, and is it a better page now than it was before? His edits are simply not good. W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 15:33, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] 1). I'm not a mod or an admin and I've never said otherwise. 2). \" I have pasted from the NHS website to here. \" ... which is a Copyright violation and isn't allowed, 3). There was consensus here to delete the GUIDE stuff you spammed everywhere. 4). I stated here \" No consensus for these edits, Why would you reinstate content that had consensus to be deleted (at the prev editsum) ?\" so why would you ignore that and post the same content back 3 months later ?, 5). The DTTR was me treating you with respect and not templating you to death - I hate when people do this to me so I was trying to be more polite and approachable to you so your \" because there's no grounds for it \" is ludicrous and silly. 6). Have you actually looked at the issues at Thomas the Tank Engine and Paw Patrol ? ... If you had you would've known those articles have been magnets for either deliberately fake information or unsourced edits, I don't revert people for the sake of it believe you me. 7). You can contest my blanking as much as you like but my edits/blanking was following our core policy; WP:COPYVIO as well as following the consensus for removing this content here . – Davey 2010 Talk 15:46, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Hi, W;ChangingUsername . I highly doubt Davey2010 was vandalising. First, there needs to be consensus about the part that you're trying to put in . Also, simply removing some parts of an article isn't vandalism unless it's removing helpful edits to Wikipedia. In this case, it's not vandalism. Also, this article still does meet the standards; it's just a stub and can be gradually worked on. Thanks, Aster 🪻 talk edits 15:47, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] If you really feel this way then I would like to resolve the issues you have with me or my content before I proceed to edit in more pages to the website, so that this doesn't keep happening (because right now I feel like it will) I think the page follows rules, and if the rules disagree with that then maybe they are wrong, and should be challenged, to allow that content. That is for something to be there until people can work on it, so they can work off that instead of working off it being a stub. And there was consensus. There was a discussion about that and a lot of people agreed, but I didn't see (outside of the original responder) the outcome of the discussion, but people supported it. I would like to know. W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 15:50, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ W;ChangingUsername , It doesn't follow any rules because you've taken the content from https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/cinnarizine/side-effects-of-cinnarizine/ which is obviously a copyright violation and isn't allowed. Auntof6 is an admin and is extremely knowledgeable with policies here and they supported the removal of the content, Yes another editor supported leaving it but that's all moot now because you've admitted it was a copyright violation, That all being said en:Cinnarizine has Side Effects in sentence form so I'd be happy for side effects to be included back HOWEVER don't just undo and readd that content back as you've taken it from the NHS - You need to reword it and jumble these up if that makes sense. – Davey 2010 Talk 16:06, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] So I can add a section for 'side effects?' And the content on that website is free to use and share. There's no copyright on the website other than what should be 'free use' and could be added to Wikipedia alongside the other content which is taken from the same website? @ Auntof6 And at the same time, I can go ahead and add more to Wikipedia, but not copyright content. Or rewriting the content as I do (which I wanted to avoid, to not un-simplify it) W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 16:27, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Yep you could add a list of side effects providing it's reliably sourced, You cannot use any of the text/sentences off of the NHS website, it's best to write yhis yourself. Thanks (submitted using mobile so apologies ive done anything incorrect, Thanks) – Davey 2010 Talk 17:39, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Thanks for resolving this issue with me. I'll get on doing that later, after trying some rewording out and getting the go-ahead so that I don't make it wrong. And thanks for helping me take steps in resolving my problems that I had with you W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 11:19, 16 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] And I would guess that the NHS website is not copyright and I believe the content is free to use - if it were, the edits would be fine to be on this website then? W;ChangingUsername W;ChangingUsername Firstly, Davey2010 is not an admin. You are adding medical instructions to the page, you are editwarring, you are breaking copyright by copying NHS information and breaking other rules. Right now you are in the wrong and close to a block. Work with other people not against them. fr33k man 16:05, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] If the content was not copyrighted (like before) Or, if I got permission from the website (NHS) owners and UK government to use the content, then would the information remain on simple_wikipedia ? I mean if permission was gained, the edits would go back. W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 16:31, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] With your second case here, due to how the licence that Wikipedia uses works ( CC-BY-SA ), that would still be considered copyright infringement in the eyes of our policies (and possibly the law).- FusionSub ( Talk page ) ( Contributions ) 16:36, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] OK, understood. I will keep that in mind for future edits to make sure they can stay up. But I will keep my ears open for more from the other person, to make sure that can happen. W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 16:42, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Fair Use [ change source ] Is fair use allowed here, like it is on the English Wikipedia ? // Kakan spelar ( talk ) 15:56, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] This is a small wiki, and we don't have the resources needed to maintain our own images.

Cosm Learner ( talk ) contribs 11:57, 17 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Chemistry (\"It is a solid.\") [ change source ] It is not enough, for an encyclopedia to say, that a compound, is \"a solid\"; In many cases it should be okay to indicate something like , \"It is a solid at room temperature at atmospheric- pressure at sea level, and in many other situations\". There should be consensus as to one or more standard phrases et cetera, about what to say about those compounds. Thoughts? For now, i don't think it is helpful to use the wiki-article Standard temperature and pressure - to explain (or link), to explain 'a solid at room-temperature at sea-level (pressure)'. (I recently tried to fix an article, by saying \"sea-level\" - but i have not fixed the 'missing part about pressure'.

Helium is an extreme example, it  melts at 0.95 K (-272 °C) and boils at 4.2 K (-269 °C). Under normal pressure, at absolute zero (0 K), it will be liquid. So, hugging my block of Helium is probably impossible. Eptalon ( talk ) 06:59, 20 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Helium is often a gas..?--In regard to \"Under normal pressure, at absolute zero (0 K)\", that does not sound like any liquid; However, it does sound troublesome, as in big-problem. 2001:2020:335:AE4B:6D0F:C33A:F723:90CC ( talk ) 12:16, 20 October 2024 (UTC) /2001:2020:333:C6E5:83A:C472:2680:1408 [ reply ] I am not a chemist, but Hydrogen melts at 14 K (-259 C) and boils at 21 K (-251 C).
