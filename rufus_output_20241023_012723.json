Selected article Powderfinger is a rock band from Brisbane , Australia . The band started in 1989. Powderfinger has five members; Bernard Fanning ( sings , plays guitar ), Darren Middleton (plays guitar), Ian Haug (plays guitar), John Collins (plays bass guitar ), and Jon Coghill (plays drums ). After some extended plays (EPs) that sold quite well, and making one full album, Powderfinger became popular in Australia with their second album; Double Allergic . Their third album, Internationalist , was even more popular and made them celebrities . It sold over 350,000 copies. Odyssey Number Five was their fourth album and was released in 2000. It is their most famous album; it was sold overseas in the United States and Canada . Powderfinger's next two albums were not as popular as the earlier ones, but still got to number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) charts . more...

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Welcome to Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit . 6,899,904 articles in English From today's featured article Wells Cathedral is an Anglican place of worship in Wells, Somerset , dedicated to Andrew the Apostle . It is the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells , whose cathedra it holds as mother church of the Diocese of Bath and Wells . Built as a Roman Catholic cathedral from around 1175 to replace an earlier church on the site since 705, it became an Anglican cathedral when Henry VIII split from Rome. Its Gothic architecture is mostly inspired from Early English style of the late 12th to early 13th centuries. The stonework of its pointed arcades and fluted piers bears pronounced mouldings and carved capitals in a foliate, \"stiff-leaf\" style. The east end retains much ancient stained glass . Unlike many cathedrals of monastic foundation, Wells has many surviving secular buildings linked to its chapter of secular canons , including the Bishop's Palace and the 15th-century residential Vicars' Close . It is a Grade I listed building .

It is found in Europe and Asia Minor, as far east as the Caspian Sea , and resides close to water bodies containing plants with a flight season running from May to July. The hairy dragonfly is named for its hairy thorax , distinguishing it from other hawkers. With a typical length of around 5.5 centimetres (2.2 in), it has a long, narrow pterostigma and features coupled, oval-shaped markings on its abdomen, blue on males and yellow on females. This male hairy dragonfly on a fern was photographed in Burren National Park , County Clare, Ireland. Photograph credit: Charles J.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For statistics about Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Statistics . The normal distribution in Statistics Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing, reading and presenting data. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Descriptive statistics make summaries of data. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Inferential statistics makes predictions. [ 6 ] Statistics helps in the study of many other fields, such as science , medicine , [ 7 ] economics , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] psychology , [ 10 ] politics [ 11 ] and marketing . [ 12 ] Someone who works in statistics is called a statistician . In addition to being the name of a field of study, the word \"statistics\"  can also mean numbers that are used to describe data or relationships. History [ change | change source ] The first known statistics are census data. The Babylonians did a census around 3500 BC , the Egyptians around 2500 BC, and the Ancient Chinese around 1000 BC. Several mathematicians during the Islamic Golden Age studied statistical inference , mainly for use in cryptanalysis . Starting in the 16th century, mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano developed the probability theory ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] this led statistics closer to being a science. Since then, people have collected and studied statistics on many things. Trees , starfish , stars , rocks , words , almost anything that can be counted has been a subject of statistics. Collecting data [ change | change source ] Before we can describe the world with statistics, we must collect data . The data that we collect in statistics are called measurements . After we collect data, we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement. For example, suppose that we want to find out how popular a certain TV show is. We can pick a group of people (called a sample ) out of the total population of viewers. Then we ask each viewer in the sample how often they watch the show. The sample is data that one can see, and the population is data that one cannot see (assuming that not every viewer in the population are asked). For another example, if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure , we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after. Descriptive and inferential statistics [ change | change source ] Numbers that describe the data one can see are called descriptive statistics. Numbers that make predictions about the data one cannot see are called inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves using numbers to describe features of data. For example, the average height of women in the United States is a descriptive statistic: it describes a feature (average height) of a population (women in the United States). Once the results have been summarized and described, they can be used for prediction. This is called inferential statistics . As an example, the size of an animal is dependent on many factors. Some of these factors are controlled by the environment, but others are by inheritance. A biologist might therefore make a model that says that there is a high probability that the offspring will be small in size—if the parents were small in size. This model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random. Testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those who are given a placebo. Methods [ change | change source ] Most often, we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments . For example, an opinion poll is one kind of survey. We pick a small number of people and we choose questions to ask them. Then, we use their answers as the data. This process of choosing which data to collect is called choosing a measurement; and the process of collecting data (in this case, who to ask) is called sampling . Samples [ change | change source ] The choice of how to collect data is important; that choice can change the values that are seen. Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake. If we take samples next to the waste drain, we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far-away and hard-to-reach spot of the lake. There are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples: If there are many samples, the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real population . If there are very few samples, however, they might be very different from what they are in the real population.  This error is called sampling error (see also Errors and residuals in statistics ). If chosen samples only account for one part of the population (like samples near the drain the beginning of the section), the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population. This is true even if a great number of samples is taken. This kind of error is called bias . Errors [ change | change source ] We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample, and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly. However, sometimes large random samples are hard to take. And bias can happen if different people are not asked, or refuse to answer our questions, or if they know they are getting a fake treatment. These problems can be hard to fix. See standard error for more. Descriptive statistics [ change | change source ] Finding one value to act in place of multiple data values [ change | change source ] Often, people find it easier to decrease the numbers that make up a set of data and work with a single number instead; many people think that the best number to choose is a number in the middle of the data (a \"typical\" value of the population). This number in the middle of the data is called its central tendency . There are three kinds of central tendencies that are often used: the mean (sometimes called the average), the median and the mode . The examples below use this sample data: Name A B C D E F G H I J Score 23 26 49 49 57 64 66 78 82 92 Mean [ change | change source ] The formula for the commonly used mean (the so-called \"arithmetic mean\") is [ 18 ] x ¯ = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N x i = x 1 + x 2 + ⋯ + x N N {\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}={\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}x_{i}={\\frac {x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots +x_{N}}{N}}} Where x 1 , x 2 , … , x N {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{N}} are the data and N {\\displaystyle N} is the population size (see also Sigma Notation ). This means that one calculates the mean by adding up all the values , and then divide by the number of values. For the example above, the mean is: x ¯ = ( 23 + 26 + 49 + 49 + 57 + 64 + 66 + 78 + 82 + 92 ) / 10 = 58.6 {\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}=(23+26+49+49+57+64+66+78+82+92)/10=58.6} The problem with the mean is that it is affected by very large or very small values. In statistics, these extreme values might be errors of measurement, but sometimes the population really does contain these values. If a set of data has one of these values, then the mean may not be similar to most or all of the original values. For example, if there are 10 people in a room who make $10 per day and 1 who makes $1,000,000 per day, then the mean of the data is $90,918 per day. The average also does not work if a set of data includes multiple groups that are much different that each other. In a room of 10 people with five people who make $10 and five people who make $100 per day, the average of these data is $55 per day. In both cases, the mean is not the amount any single person makes; this fact makes the mean not very useful for some purposes. Other kinds of means exist, like the geometric mean ; other means are useful for other purposes. Median [ change | change source ] The median is the middle item of the data. For a given data X {\\displaystyle X} , this is sometimes written as X ~ {\\displaystyle {\\widetilde {X}}} . [ 18 ] To find the median, we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number, and then choose the number in the middle. If there is an even number of data, there will not be a number right in the middle, so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean. In our example above, there are 10 items of data, the two middle ones are \"57\" and \"64\", so the median is (57+64)/2 = 60.5. As another example, like the income example presented for the mean, consider a room with 10 people who have incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000. Here, the median is $55, because $55 is the average of the two middle numbers, $50 and $60.  If the extreme value of $1,000,000 is ignored, the mean is $53.  In this case, the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out.  The median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the first example in the definition of mean above. However, the median still does not work as well for data made of multiple groups. In a room of 10 people with five people who make $10 and five people who make $100 per day, the median of these data is still $55 per day, which is still not similar to most of the people in the room. Mode [ change | change source ] The mode is the most frequent item of data. For example, if there are 10 people in a room with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, then the mode is $90, because $90 occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times. There can be more than one mode. For example, if there are 10 people in a room with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $20, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, the modes are $20 and $90. This is bi-modal, or has two modes. Bi-modality is very common, and it often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups.  For instance, the average height of all adults in the U.S. has a bi-modal distribution.  This is because males and females have separate average heights of 1.763 m (5 ft 9 + 1⁄2 in) for men and 1.622 m (5 ft 4 in) for women.  These peaks are apparent when both groups are combined. The mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order. Finding the spread of the data [ change | change source ] Another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is. A common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation . If the standard deviation of a set of data is small, then most of the data is very close to the average. If the standard deviation is large, though, then a lot of the data is very different from the average. The standard deviation of a sample is generally different from the standard deviation of its originating population . Because of that, we write σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } for population standard deviation, and s {\\displaystyle s} for sample standard deviation. [ 18 ] If the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution , then it is very useful to know the standard deviation. If the data follows this pattern (we would say the data is normally distributed ), about 68 of every 100 pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation. Not only that, but about 95 of every 100 measurements will be off the average by less than two times the standard deviation, and about 997 in 1000 will be closer to the average by less than three standard deviations. Other descriptive statistics [ change | change source ] We also can use statistics to find out that some percent , percentile , number , or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category . For example, social scientists used statistics to find out that 49% of people in the world are males .

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A volcano eruption is the release of stored energy from below the surface of Earth. The heat comes mostly from radioactive decay , and convection , in the Earth's core and mantle . [ 1 ] Earth science is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth . [ 2 ] Earth science may also be called geoscience . Geoscience is the study of the architecture of the Earth. It is a broader term than geology because it includes aspects of planetary science , which is part of astronomy . The Earth sciences include the study of the atmosphere , oceans and biosphere , as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists use ideas from physics , chemistry , biology , chronology and mathematics to understand the Earth, and how it evolved to its current state. If there is one fact which underlies all Earth science it is this: the Earth is an ancient planet which has been changing the whole time since its formation . The extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think. [ 3 ] Fields of study [ change | change source ] The Ordovician – Silurian boundary, an example of marine transgression as exposed on the Southern tip of the Hovedøya island, Norway . Due to the folding of the Caledonian mountain range, the layers have been inverted, leaving Ordovician granular limestone on top of the later Silurian brownish mudstone . The following disciplines are generally recognised as being within the geosciences: Geology describes the rocky parts of the Earth's crust (or lithosphere ) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are mineralogy and petrology , geochemistry, geomorphology , paleontology , Mineralogy , petrophysics, stratigraphy , structural geology, engineering geology and sedimentology . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Geophysics and Geodesy investigate the shape of the Earth, its reaction to forces and its magnetic and gravity fields. Geophysicists explore the Earth's core and mantle as well as the tectonic and seismic activity of the lithosphere. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Soil science covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or pedosphere). [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Oceanography and hydrology (includes limnology ) describe the marine and freshwater domains of the watery parts of the Earth (or hydrosphere ). Includes Marine biology . Glaciology covers the icy parts of the Earth (or cryosphere ). Atmospheric sciences cover the gaseous parts of the Earth (or atmosphere ) between the surface and the exosphere (about 1000 km). Major subdisciplines are meteorology , climatology , atmospheric chemistry and physics . Astronomy includes the study of distant stars and galaxies to the examination of the 4.6 billion years old Earth from an astronomical point of view. It is also closely related with the study of the solar system and its planets , a subdiscipline called planetology . A more distant relative of astronomy is physical cosmology , which aims to study the Universe as a whole. [ 10 ] Closely related to the earth sciences are physical geography and biology .

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \"BE\" redirects here. For the English language as used in the United Kingdom, see British English . BASIC English Created by Charles Kay Ogden Date 1925 Setting and usage controlled natural language Purpose constructed language BASIC English Writing system Latin Sources Modern English Language codes ISO 639-3 – IETF en-basiceng BASIC English ( B ritish A cademic S cientific I nternational C ommercial) [ 1 ] is a controlled language used to explain complex thoughts. It has 850 words chosen by Charles Kay Ogden . Some articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use only BASIC English. In 1937, Ogden hired Otto Neurath and Marie Neurath to make International Picture Language as one of eight books in BASIC English. [ 2 ] Rules of word use [ change | change source ] The word use of BASIC English is simpler and more regular than the word use of normal English. In normal English, words often have a number of different meanings . To make BASIC English easier, not all the meanings of a word are used. BASIC English uses Ogden's rules of grammar . Ogden's rules of grammar let people use the 850 words to talk about things and events simply. [ 3 ] -s / -es / -ies change singular nouns into plural nouns. -ing / -ed change verbs into adjectives . -ing / -er change verbs into nouns . -ly changes adjectives into adverbs . -er / -est or more / most describe amounts. un- changes adjectives into their opposites. The opposite word order with do makes questions. 'Operators' (verbs) and pronouns change as in normal English. Make combined words ( compounds ) from two nouns (\"football\") or a noun and a direction (\"sundown\"). Measures, numbers, money, days, months, years, clock time, and international words are in English forms. Example for Date/Time: 20 May 1972 at 21:00 Use the words of an industry or science. For example, in this grammar, some special words are for teaching languages, and not part of BASIC English: plural , conjugation , noun , adjective , adverb , qualifier , operator , pronoun , and directive .

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Axel Helsted , \"Geometry\" Geometry (from Ancient Greek : Γεωμετρία ( romanized : Geometria ( English : \"Land measurement\") derived from Γη (romanized: Ge; English: \"Earth\" or \"land\") and also derived from Μέτρον) (romanized: Métron ; English: \"A measure\")) is a branch of mathematics that studies the size , shapes , positions and dimensions of things. We can only see shapes that are flat ( 2D ) or solid ( 3D ), but mathematicians (people who study math) are able to study shapes that are 4D , 5D, 6D, and so on. Squares , circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. Cubes , cylinders , cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry . Uses [ change | change source ] Plane geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape. Solid geometry can measure a solid shape's volume and surface area . Geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things. For example, geometry can help people find: the surface area of a house , so they can buy the right amount of paint the volume of a box , to see if it is big enough to hold a liter of food the area of a farm , so it can be divided into equal parts the distance around the edge of a pond , to know how much fencing to buy . Origins [ change | change source ] Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. Geometry began as the art of surveying of land so that it could be shared fairly between people. The word \"geometry\" is from a Greek word that means \"to measure the land\". It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics. The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote the first book about geometry, a book called The Elements . Non-Euclidean geometry [ change | change source ] Plane and solid geometry, as described by Euclid in his textbook Elements , is called \"Euclidean Geometry\". This was simply called \"geometry\" for centuries. In the 19th century, mathematicians created several new kinds of geometry that changed the rules of Euclidean geometry. These and earlier kinds were called \"non-Euclidean\" (not created by Euclid). For example, hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry come from changing Euclid's parallel postulate . Non-Euclidean geometry is more complicated than Euclidean geometry but has many uses. Spherical geometry for example is used in astronomy and cartography . Examples [ change | change source ] Geometry starts with a few simple ideas that are thought to be true, called axioms. Such as: A point is shown on paper by touching it with a pencil or pen , without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no size . A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. For example, Sophie pulls a piece of string from one point to another point. A straight line between the two points will follow the path of the tight string. A plane is a flat surface that does not stop in any direction . For example, imagine a wall that extends in all directions infinitely.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This page is a guideline on the Simple English Wikipedia. Many editors agree with the ideas on this page. It is a good idea to follow it, but it is not policy . You can change the page as needed, but please use the talk page to make sure that other editors agree with any big changes. Shortcuts : WP:VGA? WP:RVGA There are many articles in Simple English Wikipedia. Some of them are better than others. To mark those articles that can be an example for how articles should be, a template has been set up. This template is called {{ vgood }} . It can be added to articles that meet the requirements listed below, and that have been voted on by the community. In other Wikipedia projects, such articles are called Featured articles . Requirements for very good articles [ change source ] The article must be about a subject that belongs in Wikipedia . There is no use improving articles that do not belong here, and better fit another wiki, like Wikibooks, Wikispecies, Wiktionary, etc. The article must be comprehensive. A comprehensive article is one which does not miss any major facts and details. The article should be several kilobytes long, not including infoboxes, images, references, other websites, interwiki, and categories. However, this is not a strict rule. The article must have gone through a few revisions, possibly by different editors. No one writes perfect articles. The article must be placed in the appropriate category. It must have at least one interwiki link. The article should be stable . It should not have many recent big changes or any current change wars . All important terms should be linked and there must be no red links left. Red links point to articles that do not exist yet. Usually the important word or phrase is only linked the first time it occurs. If there are any illustrations, they must be related to the article. They must also be properly labelled. There must be no templates pointing to the fact that the article needs improvement. These templates include {{ complex }} , {{ cleanup }} , {{ stub }} , {{ unreferenced }} and {{ wikify }} . The article also should not need them. Content that is from books, journal articles or other publications needs to be referenced. This can either be done with <ref>..</ref><references/> tags, or as a list of publications. For articles that have references or external links on the English Wikipedia, there must be at least one in the Simple English article as well. How to make an article very good [ change source ] To be able to mark a certain article very good, there is a certain procedure that should be followed. When the article meets at least 6 of the criteria mentioned above, a named contributor can add it to the Proposed very good articles page. He or she can also add the {{ pvgood }} tag at this time. The talk page of the article in question is the place to discuss what the article still needs, or how the work can be co-ordinated. When the article meets all ten of the criteria, it can be voted on. For this, the article is moved to the voting section on the Proposed very good articles page. Any named editor can vote. Within one week of being listed under the voting section, 80% of named editors must agree that the article is indeed very good. There is a required minimum of 6 named voters. If the voting is successful, the {{ pvgood }} tag is replaced by the {{ vgood }} tag on the article's main page and {{ vgood-large }} is added to the top of the article's talk page. Making large changes to very good articles [ change source ] Because the process of becoming a very good article is long, larger edits (beyond spellchecking/link-fixing) to current very good articles should be talked about on the talk page of the article before they are made. Demoting very good articles [ change source ] Sometimes a very good article is changed in such a way that it no longer meets the criteria above, or new information may become available about the topic, making the article incomplete. In such a case, the article should be demoted from very good article status. Demotion of a VGA can be done in this way: A named editor notices that the article no longer meets the criteria. The editor places the article on Wikipedia:Proposed article demotion and adds a special template that shows that the article is currently being reviewed and improved. For two weeks following the discovery, the article can be fixed to again meet the criteria. If there is agreement that the problem has been fixed during this time, there does not need to be a re-vote; a named editor can remove the tag from the article, and put the \"vgood\" tag back. If the problem is not fixed, the article will lose its status after the two week period. When the article once again meets the criteria, it can be re-nominated for VGA status and will follow the full promotion process from beginning to end.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia History is the study of past events. People know what happened in the past by looking at things from the past including sources (like books , newspapers , scripts and letters ), buildings and different types of artifacts (like pottery , tools , coins and human or animal remains.) Libraries , archives , and museums collect and keep these things for people to study history. A person who studies history is called a historian . A person who studies pre-history and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an archaeologist . A person who studies mankind and society is called an anthropologist . The study of the sources and methods used to study and write history is called historiography . People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened at some point in the past. This is called oral history . For example, when people who had been slaves and American Civil War survivors got old, some historians recorded them talking about their lives, so that history would not be lost. [ 1 ] In old times people in different parts of the world kept separate histories because they did not meet each other very often. Some groups of people never met each other. The rulers of Medieval Europe , Ancient Rome and Ancient China each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were \" barbarian \". But they were still connected, even if they didn't realize it. [ 2 ] The term \" historically\" is used to say that something has been a certain way during most of its history. For example, a historically female university is a university which has had a student body that was mostly or entirely female for most of its history.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Welcome to Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit . 6,899,904 articles in English From today's featured article Wells Cathedral is an Anglican place of worship in Wells, Somerset , dedicated to Andrew the Apostle . It is the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells , whose cathedra it holds as mother church of the Diocese of Bath and Wells . Built as a Roman Catholic cathedral from around 1175 to replace an earlier church on the site since 705, it became an Anglican cathedral when Henry VIII split from Rome. Its Gothic architecture is mostly inspired from Early English style of the late 12th to early 13th centuries. The stonework of its pointed arcades and fluted piers bears pronounced mouldings and carved capitals in a foliate, \"stiff-leaf\" style. The east end retains much ancient stained glass . Unlike many cathedrals of monastic foundation, Wells has many surviving secular buildings linked to its chapter of secular canons , including the Bishop's Palace and the 15th-century residential Vicars' Close . It is a Grade I listed building .

It is found in Europe and Asia Minor, as far east as the Caspian Sea , and resides close to water bodies containing plants with a flight season running from May to July. The hairy dragonfly is named for its hairy thorax , distinguishing it from other hawkers. With a typical length of around 5.5 centimetres (2.2 in), it has a long, narrow pterostigma and features coupled, oval-shaped markings on its abdomen, blue on males and yellow on females. This male hairy dragonfly on a fern was photographed in Burren National Park , County Clare, Ireland. Photograph credit: Charles J.

From Meta, a Wikimedia project coordination wiki (Redirected from How to start a new Wikipedia ) How to start a new Wikipedia This page is an unofficial guide for creating a Wikipedia in a new language. The official policies and processes are described on these pages: Requests for new languages , Language proposal policy , and incubator:Help:Manual . Do you want to start a Wikipedia in your language ? Having a Wikipedia in all languages is great. However, please realize that while the world-wide Wikimedia community will be happy to give you the technical support in creating a space for your language, you will actually have to do the writing, and it could require a lot of work. It will take some time to become ready to \"go live\". You need to be able to write your language well, and it is strongly recommended to team up with other speakers of that language. While this is not a requirement, it is also good to be experienced in editing a Wikipedia in another language. Check whether your language already has one There are editions of Wikipedia in more than 300 languages, so maybe there already is a Wikipedia in your language! Here are a few places where you can check for it: Look at the page List of Wikipedias . Look at https://www.wikipedia.org , the portal page. Go to the article about your language in a Wikipedia in a large language, such as English. These articles usually have a link to the Wikipedia in the language at the bottom. If you cannot find an existing Wikipedia in your language, check the page Requests for new languages —there may be a request for it already. Please be patient. It can take up to four months or longer. Getting help If you do not already use another Wikipedia, you might have many questions when you begin. For answers regarding your questions, you may contact other Wikipedians. For example, you can contact people using mailing lists (especially \"Wikimedia-L\"), Telegram groups (especially Wikimedia General and Wikimedia Language Diversity ), and the channel #wikimedia on IRC . Here are some particular people on Meta willing to help: Amir E. Aharoni Jon Harald Søby Creating the initial content Create the Incubator Follow the instructions on the page incubator:Help:Manual , and create the initial pages there. Create a Main Page Create your own Main Page for the Incubator. You may also go to the main page of another Wikipedia and translate it into your language. Note that main pages tend to have advanced code, and in the first stages of creating the Incubator, the articles are much more important than the main page. The initial main page should be simple and functional. You can create a cool-looking main page later, after you gain experience editing usual articles. How to edit a page You should translate the page How to edit a page into your language. Another helpful link: Help:Starting a new page . Translate the interface To start a Wikipedia in a new language, you also need to translate the user interface of the software that runs it, called \"MediaWiki\". This is done on the site https://translatewiki.net . Note that it uses a separate user account. Translating the \"Most important\" messages is a condition for creating a new Wikipedia, but much more should be translated so that readers and editors would be able to use Wikipedia fully in your language. Even before translating the user interface, it is recommended to settle on the basic terminology about wiki editing—words such as \"page\", \"user\", \"log in\", \"account\", \"editor\", \"block\", etc. The most convenient way to do it is to read the Basic glossary on translatewiki, discuss it with other people who know your language well, and translate that glossary. (It's recommended to translate at least the terms, but translating the explanations and the definitions is recommended, too.) Special characters If your language has characters that are difficult to enter on keyboards used by speakers of the language, you should add support for it to the Universal Language Selector . Ask for it at Help talk:Extension:UniversalLanguageSelector/Input methods . You can also add a box of special characters to insert using the Edittools message. Going further Translate other things The name Wikipedia and the tagline \"The Free Encyclopedia\", which appear in the logo, must be translated, too. Some notes: The name Wikipedia can be spelled differently if the rules of your language require it, but it should generally be based on the English name. For example, the name in the Catalan is \"Viquipèdia\", because the standard Catalan alphabet doesn't include the letters W and K. If your language is not written in the Latin alphabet, the name should be written in that alphabet. In the translation of the free encyclopedia , the word free means \"not restricted.\" This sometimes confuses people because English does not have different words for free (as in price or cost - like the French word \"gratuit\") and free (as in freedom or liberty - like the French word \"libre\"). If your language has different words for the two kinds of \"free\", please use the one that refers to freedom or liberty. For more information on this, see this essay on the English Wikipedia: Wikipedia:The Free Encyclopedia . The word \"Encyclopedia\" can be translated in any way that is correct in your language. It can be a transliteration of the English word, or a completely new word that has the same. Make sure that you understand the different between an encyclopedia and dictionary; if you are not sure, please read the relevant articles: Encyclopedia , Dictionary . Prepare the Community pages Each Wikimedia project has a place where users go to talk about things. In the English Wikipedia, for example, this is the Village pump . The French Wikipedia has Le Bistro . Please choose a name for the community page and then create the page. You will need a page where writers and editors can write their name and location. One idea is to use the page of en:Wikipedia:Wikipedians as a base and translate it in your language. Set up basic guidelines There are a few rules that all Wikimedia projects must follow: You cannot violate the terms of a copyright. Please make a page to warn users not to copy things from other places without asking the author. As of 2022, Wikipedia articles are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License . (The GNU Free Documentation License was used in the past and still applies for backwards compatibility in some cases.) Very briefly, it means that everyone is free to read, copy, change, and redistribute the content, but please read the full license to understand it. You should also make a page in your language to explain it and publish it in the Wikipedia. Authors must write from a neutral point of view (NPOV). Please make a page to explain this. Please make a page to explain what Wikipedia is not . Other than these all-projects rules, each Wikipedia has created its own rules. Some rules you might want to have right away include: Orthographic practices - if there is more than one way to spell or write your language, you will need rules about it. Stylistic conventions - if your language does not have a standardized universal form (the way everybody writes it to understand each other), you will need to have one or have a rule to tell people which forms or dialects of your language to use. Also, you will need more complex stylistic conventions. For examples in many languages, see the page Language guides . Naming conventions Add a style guide and resources for writers You want to have a high-quality encyclopedia. Please write a few suggestions for writers. Are there any websites in your language about how to write? Maybe you want to add a dictionary or a grammar guide here. Put in everything that could be useful for writers. Write a few good content articles as an example for others You might want to write a few articles for your Wikipedia to get it started, and to give an example to other possible writers. You can translate an article from a different Wikipedia, or you can write an original article. Have cooperation between the Wikipedia in your language and other Wikipedias We think that you should join some mailing lists so that you will know what is happening. The mailing lists are also good resources you can use to learn from the things that are happening on other Wikipedias. Please make a local Wikimedia Embassy for multilingual cooperation. (make yourself a page so that we can talk to you more easily, and write a name for a contact) If you want to have a central place where you can find out what is going on in the whole Wikipedia community, go to goings-on . Permissions You might need someone with administrator (sysop) status very soon. Add your request on Requests for permissions . Promote your Wikipedia Find appropriate newsgroups, forums, discussion lists, and so on, where people are interested that the Wikipedia has started in their language. Offer to write an article for a local newspaper about your work on the project, and its cultural value to society. Lecture at conferences where the topic would be appropriate. Create a small brochure or poster about Wikipedia in your language. Add a link to Wikipedia in your email signature. Now your language is ready for the public! Try to convince your friends to join the project, and explain how the Wikipedia works. Thank you for working hard!

Unsourced material may be challenged or removed. Find sources: \"Radio\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A radio tower Radio is a way to send electromagnetic signals over a long distance, to deliver information from one place to another.  A machine that sends radio waves is called a transmitter , while a machine that \"picks up\" the signals is called a receiver or antenna. A machine that does both jobs is a \"transceiver\". When radio signals are sent out to many receivers at the same time, it is called a broadcast . Television also uses radio signals to send pictures and sound. Airplanes and other things may be used under radio control .  Radio signals can be used to lock and unlock the doors in a car from a distance. Sound can be sent by radio, sometimes through Frequency Modulation ( FM ) or Amplitude Modulation ( AM ). [ 1 ] History of radio [ change | change source ] Many people worked to make radio possible. After James Clerk Maxwell predicted them, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in Germany first showed that radio waves exist. [ 2 ] Guglielmo Marconi in Italy made radio into a practical tool of telegraphy , [ 3 ] used mainly by ships at sea. He is sometimes said to have invented radio. Later inventors learned to transmit voices , which led to broadcasting of news , music and entertainment . Uses of radio [ change | change source ] Radio was first created as a way to send telegraph messages between two people without wires. Then two-way radio brought voice communication, including walkie-talkies and eventually mobile phones . Radio waves are still used to send messages between people. Talking to someone with a radio is different than \"talk radio\". Citizens band radio and amateur radio use specific radios to talk back and forth. Policemen , firemen and other people who help in emergency use a radio emergency communication system to communicate (talk to each other). It is like a mobile phone , (which also uses radio signals) but the distance they reach is shorter and both people must use the same kind of radio. The word \"radio\" is sometimes used to mean only voiceband broadcasting . Most voiceband broadcasting uses lower frequency and longer wavelength than most television broadcasting. Voiceband broadcasting sends music , news and entertainers including \"talk radio\". Radio shows were used before there were TV programs. In the 1930s, the US president started sending a message about the country every week to the American people. Companies that make and send radio programming are called radio station s. These are sometimes run by governments, and sometimes by private companies, who make money by sending advertisements . Other radio stations are supported by local communities. These are called community radio stations. In the early days, manufacturing companies would pay to broadcast complete stories on the radio. These were often plays or dramas . Because companies who made soap often paid for them, these were called \" soap operas \". Microwaves have even higher frequency ; shorter wavelength . They also are used to transmit television and radio programs, and for other purposes. Communications satellites relay microwaves around the world. A radio receiver does not need to be directly in view of the transmitter to receive programme signals. Low frequency radio waves can bend around hills by diffraction , although repeater stations are often used to improve the quality of the signals. Shortwave radio frequencies are also reflected from an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere, called the Ionosphere . The waves can bounce between the ionosphere and the earth to reach receivers that are not in the line of sight because of the curvature of the Earth's surface.  They can reach very far, sometimes around the world. Radio telescopes receive radio waves from the sky to study astronomical objects . Satellite navigation uses radio to determine location, and radar uses it to find and track things. Related pages [ change | change source ] The Simple English Wiktionary has a definition for: radio .

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Gothic Revival architecture for Santuario de Las Lajas , Ipiales, Colombia The Parthenon in Greece one of the seven wonders of the ancient world Architecture is the process of designing structures and buildings . It uses both art and engineering . Examples include houses, churches , hotels , office buildings, roads, tunnels and bridges . [ 1 ] Architecture is the profession of an architect . Usually, a person must study at an institution of higher education (university) to become an architect . [ 2 ] There were architects long before there was higher education . They learnt by being an apprentice to an established architect. Architecture can do small designs, [ 3 ] such as for a garage , or large designs, such as for a whole new town . The capital cities of Brasília , [ 4 ] and Canberra were designed. Architects often work with structural engineers to make structurally sound buildings. History [ change | change source ] Romanesque groin vault In the past, people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures, like the Great Pyramids of Giza . The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call \" Classical Architecture \". The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the arch from the Etruscans , who copied it from the Mesopotamians . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] A simpler building, in Hungary Classical architecture was formal, and it always obeyed laws . It used symmetry , which really means balance , and it used proportion between shapes. The Golden Mean was a rule which said, (to put it simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times as long as the short side. [ 7 ] There are many 'laws' in classical architecture, like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are often used today. However, today more notice is taken of specific facts, such as what wind speeds occur once or twice in a century. Several bridges have blown down because that was not properly taken into consideration. In some parts of the world, like India , the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles occur in China , Japan , Southeast Asia, Africa , Mexico , and Central and South America . Architects in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture , then Gothic architecture . Gothic buildings have tall, pointed windows and arches. Many churches have Gothic architecture. Castles were also built at this time. In Eastern Europe , churches usually had domes . People added their own ideas and decoration to the Classical Architecture of the past. The Renaissance brought a return to classical ideas. Architecture can have many styles, such as the curved Guggenheim Museum in New York City In the late 18th century with the Industrial Revolution , people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many factories and mills were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the Victorian era , architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathedral in Ulm , Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse. This happened to the Beauvais Cathedral , which was never completed. New technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the Willis Tower in Chicago Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, steel became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build. An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris . Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them skyscrapers . This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings. Modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called \"post-modern\". Many of the world's greatest structures were built by modern-day architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright ; Sir Hugh Casson; Norman Foster; I. M. Pei ; Adrian Smith ; Edward Durell Stone ; Frank Gehry ; Fazlur Khan ; Gottfried Böhm ; and Bruce Graham .

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A painting by Renoir is a work of art. Art is a creative activity. It produces a product, an object. Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, performing subjects, and expressing the author's thoughts. The product of art is called a work of art , for others to experience. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay bowl that can be used. That kind of art is sometimes called a craft . Those who make art are called artists . They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it. Some people find art relaxing, exciting or informative. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity . \" The arts \" is a much broader term. It includes drawing , painting , sculpting , photography , performance art , dance , music , poetry , prose and theatre . Types of art [ change | change source ] Statues [ permanent dead link ] made by Botero, in front of the Culture Palace in Medellin, Colombia A scene from the Musical Chicago, performed at a theatre, in Brno . Nude Recumbent Woman, is a photograph by Jean-Christophe Destailleur. It was a featured image on Commons and is also a work of art. Art is divided into the plastic arts , where something is made, and the performing arts , where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content. Plastic art Fine art is expression by making something beautiful or appealing to the emotions by visual means: drawing , painting , printmaking , sculpture Literature: poetry , creative writing Performing art Performing arts are expression using the body: drama , dance , acting , singing Auditory art (expression by making sounds ): music , singing Practical art Culinary art (expression by making flavors and tastes ): cooking The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: architecture , filming , fashion , photography , video games ) What \"art\" means [ change | change source ] Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind , spirit and soul . Art can also be an Idea or a concept that is expressed visually.  An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it. Some people also get inspired. The first and broadest sense of \"art\" means \"arrangement\" or \"to arrange.\" In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors or forms next to each other to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting look.  Art can also be an an existing object that is presented and called art, this is called re contextualizing. This is often done by placing the object in a frame or a special setting like a Gallery were the new setting gives the object a different meaning or message. (Marcel Duchamp, Fountain, 1917) The difference between Art and design can be subjective to the viewer and hard to distinguish. Art is often said to have a message or a meaning and design is about only the appearance. Art may express emotion .  Artists may feel a certain emotion or message and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them.  Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience .  However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion or the message as well, then the art work may become publicly successful. History of art [ change | change source ] There are sculptures, cave painting and rock art dating from the Upper Paleolithic era. All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt , India , China , Greece , Rome and Persia had works and styles of art. In the Middle Ages , most of the art in Europe showed people from the Bible in paintings , stained-glass windows, and mosaic tile floors and walls. Islamic art includes geometric patterns, Islamic calligraphy , and architecture . In India and Tibet , painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included jade carving, bronze, pottery , poetry , calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty. In Europe, after the Middle Ages , there was a \" Renaissance \" which means \"rebirth\". People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented perspective where things in the distance look smaller in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other. These artists used nudity regularly in their art. In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism , Romanticism , Realism , and Impressionism . The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism , Fauvism , Cubism , Dadaism , Surrealism , and Minimalism . Roles of art [ change | change source ] In some societies , people think that art belongs to the person who made it. They think that the artist put his or her \" talent \" and industry into the art. In this view, the art is the property of the artist, protected by copyright . In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a collective that has made the art, through the artist. Functions of art [ change | change source ] The functions of art include: [ 4 ] 1) Cognitive function Works of art let us know about what the creator thought or knew, and what the surroundings of the author were like, real or imagined. 2) Aesthetic function Works of art can make people happy by being beautiful or evoke any of the emotions. 3) Prognostic function Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not... 4) Recreation function Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest. 5) Value function What did the artist value? What aims did they like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works. 6) Didactic function What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Note : This page describes what Wikipedia and the Simple English Wikipedia is about for new users, and is not a Wikipedia article. There are article pages about Wikipedia and the Simple English Wikipedia . For the introduction for users coming from the English Wikipedia, see WP:EnWP . Shortcuts WP:ABOUT WP:WIKIPEDIA WP:HELLO WP:SEW WP:SEWP WP:SIMPLE The Simple English Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia for people who are learning English. The Simple English Wikipedia's articles can be used to help with school homework or just for the fun of learning about new ideas . Non-English Wikipedias can also translate from the articles here. Wikipedia started on January 15 , 2001 and it has over 35,000,000 articles in many languages, including 258,566 in Simple English. Most of these articles are in languages other than English. Every day, hundreds of people from around the world make hundreds of changes and create lots of new articles. Note: Wikipedia has pages that some people might think are bad, vulgar, or mean. Read the Wikipedia content disclaimer for more information. What is the Simple English Wikipedia? Articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use fewer words and grammar that is easier to understand than the normal English Wikipedia . The Simple English Wikipedia is also for people with different needs, such as children , students , and adults with learning difficulties , and people who are trying to learn English. Other people may use the Simple English Wikipedia because simple language helps them to understand unfamiliar topics or complex ideas. When the Simple English Wikipedia began, the normal English Wikipedia already had 150,000 articles, and seven other Wikipedias in other languages had over 15,000 articles. Since the other Wikipedias already have so many articles, most Simple English articles take articles from other Wikipedias and make them simple; they are usually not new articles. This makes Simple English articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the normal English Wikipedia. If someone cannot understand an idea in complex English, they can read the Simple English article. For this reason, people writing Simple English articles should put in \" interwiki links \" to and from the other Wikipedias. Also, it is good to always look at all versions in all languages, to get new ideas. \" Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not \" has a good list of things which we are not doing. These things are a little different from the things the normal English Wikipedia does not do. For example, in the Simple English version it is more important to explain slang , idioms , and jargon . The Simple English Wikipedia also has some articles that are also on Wiktionary . Changing pages in the Simple English Wikipedia Wikipedia is a wiki , a kind of website written by many people together. This means anyone can change any page by clicking on the \"change this page\" link. You can do this on any page that is not protected . You can see if the page is protected because it will say \"View source\" instead of \"Change\". Anyone can write in the Simple English Wikipedia. Simple English writers are very mixed, more so than at English Wikipedia, or at other Wikipedias. It is important to respect the different types of people who are writing articles in the Simple English Wikipedia and to be friendly with people who have trouble speaking English. Remember that Wikipedia is a service which many communities use. If you want to write articles for the Simple English Wikipedia, read Wikipedia:How to write Simple English articles . See Wikipedia for a simple English introduction to the project in all languages, and Wikipedia:Useful for a list of pages that can help you more. You can ask questions at Wikipedia:Simple talk . Any pages that you write and any changes that you make are yours. A license called the GNU Free Documentation License guarantees that people will always be able to use and make copies of all of Wikipedia, including your pages and changes. Read the page about copyrights for more information. Simple English See the main article: Basic English Simple English is similar to English, but it only uses basic words. We suggest that articles should use only the 1,000 most common and basic words in English. They should also use only simple grammar and shorter sentences. Writers can also use a special system, for example, Basic English . Of course, people can write original articles; these could be put in both this and the English Wikipedia (with a normal level of English). Usually, only about 2,000 words are enough to write a normal article. Since some articles need more than the most common words, some complex articles use more words. But even very basic concepts ( zero , one , two ) are too difficult to explain with a small number of words. For detailed writing about science , politics , or religion , articles sometimes need more words, but the English must be simple. Sometimes, an article needs words not included in the Basic English combined wordlist , but it explains all the difficult words. Articles may also need some complex words because of the article names in the normal English Wikipedia , and to use normal words would make the article too simple. Articles on scientific topics might also need complex words. There are no rules about vocabulary , tense , or suffixes . Some articles use only Basic English (850 words), but this wiki has no strong rules about which words can be used, as E Prime does. If a word is not simple or not used often here, it should be explained on a new page. Be part of Wikipedia Welcome, newcomers! , a place to start for new people. Rules for how to behave on Wikipedia.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This page is not in simple English. To help to translate it into simple English - see the Simple English GFDL page. See also GNU Free Documentation License for what the GFDL is. Do not edit this page Version 1.2, November 2002 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements.\" 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

Other rights .

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b) ; and You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 – Term and Termination. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a) , it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. Sections 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 – Interpretation. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Wikipedia:Simple English Wikipedia ) Note : This page describes what Wikipedia and the Simple English Wikipedia is about for new users, and is not a Wikipedia article. There are article pages about Wikipedia and the Simple English Wikipedia . For the introduction for users coming from the English Wikipedia, see WP:EnWP . Shortcuts WP:ABOUT WP:WIKIPEDIA WP:HELLO WP:SEW WP:SEWP WP:SIMPLE The Simple English Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia for people who are learning English. The Simple English Wikipedia's articles can be used to help with school homework or just for the fun of learning about new ideas . Non-English Wikipedias can also translate from the articles here. Wikipedia started on January 15 , 2001 and it has over 35,000,000 articles in many languages, including 258,610 in Simple English. Most of these articles are in languages other than English. Every day, hundreds of people from around the world make hundreds of changes and create lots of new articles. Note: Wikipedia has pages that some people might think are bad, vulgar, or mean. Read the Wikipedia content disclaimer for more information. What is the Simple English Wikipedia? Articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use fewer words and grammar that is easier to understand than the normal English Wikipedia . The Simple English Wikipedia is also for people with different needs, such as children , students , and adults with learning difficulties , and people who are trying to learn English. Other people may use the Simple English Wikipedia because simple language helps them to understand unfamiliar topics or complex ideas. When the Simple English Wikipedia began, the normal English Wikipedia already had 150,000 articles, and seven other Wikipedias in other languages had over 15,000 articles. Since the other Wikipedias already have so many articles, most Simple English articles take articles from other Wikipedias and make them simple; they are usually not new articles. This makes Simple English articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the normal English Wikipedia. If someone cannot understand an idea in complex English, they can read the Simple English article. For this reason, people writing Simple English articles should put in \" interwiki links \" to and from the other Wikipedias. Also, it is good to always look at all versions in all languages, to get new ideas. \" Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not \" has a good list of things which we are not doing. These things are a little different from the things the normal English Wikipedia does not do. For example, in the Simple English version it is more important to explain slang , idioms , and jargon . The Simple English Wikipedia also has some articles that are also on Wiktionary . Changing pages in the Simple English Wikipedia Wikipedia is a wiki , a kind of website written by many people together. This means anyone can change any page by clicking on the \"change this page\" link. You can do this on any page that is not protected . You can see if the page is protected because it will say \"View source\" instead of \"Change\". Anyone can write in the Simple English Wikipedia. Simple English writers are very mixed, more so than at English Wikipedia, or at other Wikipedias. It is important to respect the different types of people who are writing articles in the Simple English Wikipedia and to be friendly with people who have trouble speaking English. Remember that Wikipedia is a service which many communities use. If you want to write articles for the Simple English Wikipedia, read Wikipedia:How to write Simple English articles . See Wikipedia for a simple English introduction to the project in all languages, and Wikipedia:Useful for a list of pages that can help you more. You can ask questions at Wikipedia:Simple talk . Any pages that you write and any changes that you make are yours. A license called the GNU Free Documentation License guarantees that people will always be able to use and make copies of all of Wikipedia, including your pages and changes. Read the page about copyrights for more information. Simple English See the main article: Basic English Simple English is similar to English, but it only uses basic words. We suggest that articles should use only the 1,000 most common and basic words in English. They should also use only simple grammar and shorter sentences. Writers can also use a special system, for example, Basic English . Of course, people can write original articles; these could be put in both this and the English Wikipedia (with a normal level of English). Usually, only about 2,000 words are enough to write a normal article. Since some articles need more than the most common words, some complex articles use more words. But even very basic concepts ( zero , one , two ) are too difficult to explain with a small number of words. For detailed writing about science , politics , or religion , articles sometimes need more words, but the English must be simple. Sometimes, an article needs words not included in the Basic English combined wordlist , but it explains all the difficult words. Articles may also need some complex words because of the article names in the normal English Wikipedia , and to use normal words would make the article too simple. Articles on scientific topics might also need complex words. There are no rules about vocabulary , tense , or suffixes . Some articles use only Basic English (850 words), but this wiki has no strong rules about which words can be used, as E Prime does. If a word is not simple or not used often here, it should be explained on a new page. Be part of Wikipedia Welcome, newcomers! , a place to start for new people. Rules for how to behave on Wikipedia.

Selected article Map of the storm on October 10 The 1910 Cuba hurricane was said to be one of the worst tropical cyclones that has ever hit Cuba . The storm formed in the southern Caribbean Sea on October 9, 1910. It grew stronger as it moved northwest. It then made landfall on the western end of Cuba. The storm made a loop over open water, and then began moving towards the United States . After crossing Florida , the storm moved near the rest of the southeastern United States and passed out to sea. Because of the storm's loop, some reports said it was actually two hurricanes. In Cuba, the storm was one of the worst disasters in the island's history. There was bad damage and thousands of people lost their homes. In Florida, the storm also caused damage and caused flooding in some areas. It is not known exactly how much damage the storm caused. However, losses in Havana , Cuba were over $ 1 million. At least 100 people died in Cuba alone. more... Other very good articles – Proposals – Requirements Did you know...

For our official legal version, please see the English-language Wikipedia . WIKIPEDIA CAN BE WRONG Wikipedia is an encyclopedia on the Internet that is edited by anyone who wants to help. The way it works means that anyone with who can view the Internet can change what is written. When you read Wikipedia, you should remember that we cannot make sure that our information is checked by people who can make it complete, accurate or reliable. That does not mean that there is not useful, correct information in Wikipedia; there is lots.  However, Wikipedia cannot make sure the information here is correct. Any article may have been changed or vandalized by someone who thinks they know what is correct, but is not aware of the current facts of the topics they are writing about. No system of checks by experts We are developing ways to find versions of articles which are more correct, and show them to our readers. The people who help make Wikipedia use up-to-date lists like the Special:Recentchanges and Special:Newpages to watch new and changing pages. However, Wikipedia is not all checked by experts. Although readers might correct errors and some experts may check some articles , they do not have a duty to make changes. So, just because we have information here, this does not mean that we think it is all true, or useful for anything you want to do with it. We are not promising you that it is correct. Before you think that something might be correct, remember that all articles might have been badly changed to be wrong just before you see them, even ones that had - before - been checked by experts or chosen as very good articles . None of the editors, sponsors or administrators of Wikipedia, or anyone else connected with Wikipedia in any way at all can be responsible (their fault) for any information that is not correct.

Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy This is a summary of the Privacy Policy. To read the full terms, scroll down or click here . Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full Privacy Policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to our Privacy Policy. Because we believe that you should not have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may: Read, edit, or use any Wikimedia Site without registering an account . Register for an account without providing an email address or real name. Because we want to understand how Wikimedia Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you: Make public contributions . Register an account or update your user page. Use the Wikimedia Sites. Send us emails or participate in a survey or give feedback . We are committed to: Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy. Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure . Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes. Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the Wikimedia Sites , to comply with the law , or to protect you and others . Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. Be aware: Any content you add or any change that you make to a Wikimedia Site will be publicly and permanently available . If you add content or make a change to a Wikimedia Site without logging in , that content or change will be publicly and permanently attributed to the IP address used at the time rather than a username. Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the Wikimedia Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the Wikimedia Sites and enforce policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to all sites and services run by the Wikimedia Foundation, such as sites or services that have their own privacy policy (like the Wikimedia Shop ) or sites or services run by third parties (like third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services ). As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites. Introduction Use of info Sharing Protection Important info Introduction Welcome! The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia , Wikimedia Commons , and Wiktionary . This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information. We collect very little Personal Information about you. We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties. By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy. The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial. We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important. We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites. We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you. After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive. Definitions Back to top We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like \"tracking pixels\" and \"cookies\" used in the Privacy Policy. Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful. Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations: When we say... ...we mean: \"the Wikimedia Foundation\" / \"the Foundation\" / \"we\" / \"us\" / \"our\" The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites. \"Wikimedia Sites\" / \"our services\" Wikimedia websites and services (regardless of language), including our main projects , such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), emails, and notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the \"What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover\" section below. \"you\" / \"your\" / \"me\" You, regardless of whether you are an individual, group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the Wikimedia Sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else. \"this Policy\" / \"this Privacy Policy\" This document, entitled the \"Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy\". \"contributions\" Content you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites. \"Personal information\" Information you provide us or information we collect that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be \"personal information\" if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you: (a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, payment account number; (b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion. \"third party\" / \"third parties\" Individuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This includes other Wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimedia chapters , thematic organizations , and user groups as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients , and contractors of those organizations or groups. What This Privacy Policy Does and Does Not Cover Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below. Expand Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language: All of our major sites (found at list of major projects ), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards. Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services). Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications. Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you. This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop ) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services ). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below. Expand More on what the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy does not cover This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy. Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include: Wikipedia Store (covered by the shop's policy ); donate.wikimedia.org , including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy ); and The Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension , which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy . This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded. If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy. Community members The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. This global community of volunteers may sometimes have access to personal Information in order to ensure the functioning of the Wikimedia Sites. Administrative volunteers , such as CheckUsers or Stewards . These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to nonpublic personal data policy , as well as other, tool-specific policies. Tool providers . We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org . When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on. Other users . We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include: posting to Foundation-hosted email lists; requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to info wikimedia.org goes to this system); emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the \"Email this user\" feature); and chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel). Third parties This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of: Websites run by other organizations , like websites linked to from the \"References\" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations . These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies. Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals . These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies. Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy wikimedia.org so we can investigate. Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy , the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy. Back to top Collection & Use of Info Types of Information We Receive From You & How We Get It Your Public Contributions Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone. When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the \"How We Use Information We Receive From You\" section of this Privacy Policy. Expand Publicly Visible Information Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions. You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender. Back to top Account Information & Registration You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site. If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the \"Email this user\" feature for example). If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address . Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem! You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances . However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device. If you want to create a standard account , in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password. Expand More on Usernames Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information. Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects. To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that. Back to top Location Information GPS & Other Location Technologies Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in. If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ . Back to top Metadata Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata , such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device. Back to top IP Addresses Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server ) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location . Back to top Information Related to Your Use of the Wikimedia Sites We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites. Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you. We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy. Back to top Information We Receive Automatically Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser , your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system , in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites. Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends. Back to top Information We Collect We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you. We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels , JavaScript , and a variety of \"locally stored data\" technologies, such as cookies and local storage . These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them. Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address ), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information. We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org . Expand More on Locally Stored Data Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like: Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area. Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you. Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in. Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you. Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field. Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ . We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ . While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data. While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site. Back to top How We Use Information We Receive From You General We and our service providers use your information for the legitimate purpose of pursuing our charitable mission, including: Expand Operating the Wikimedia Sites, sharing your contributions and administering our Services.

Back to top Other Location information GPS & Other Location Technologies As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites. Back to top Metadata As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device. Back to top IP Addresses When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled \"For Legal Reasons\" and \"To Protect You, Ourselves & Others.\" Back to top Sharing When May We Share Your Information? We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below. With Your Permission We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ . Back to top For Legal Reasons We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our Requests for user information procedures and guidelines . We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations. We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you. For more information, see our Subpoena FAQ . Back to top If the Organization is Transferred (Really Unlikely!) In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Back to top To Protect You, Ourselves & Others We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to: enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies; protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person. We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations. We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use , this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions. Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy . These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation. We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.) Back to top To Our Service Providers We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission. We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our FAQ . If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page . Back to top To Understand & Experiment We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites. We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites. When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest. The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites. Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites. When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ .) Back to top Because You Made It Public Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone. Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere. Back to top Protection How Do We Protect Your Personal Information? We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures). We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email . Back to top How Long Do We Keep Your Data? Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law. Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ .) Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your IP address (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines . Back to top Your rights If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us. For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ . If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may Contact Us . We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law. Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This page is a guideline on the Simple English Wikipedia. Many editors agree with the ideas on this page. It is a good idea to follow it, but it is not policy . You can change the page as needed, but please use the talk page to make sure that other editors agree with any big changes. Shortcuts : WP:HOW WP:COMPLEX This page tells how to write articles in Simple English . Articles in Simple English Wikipedia are for everyone. This includes children and adults who are learning English. Articles should be about notable encyclopedic subjects. Think about our readers First, think about our readers. Many readers of Simple English are people whose first language is not English. Other readers may be young (they may be children who do not have much knowledge of English ) or have learning difficulties . The language is simple, but the ideas do not have to be. If you find anything wrong, please correct it. Basic English and VOA Special English Simple English Wikipedia follows some of the rules of Basic English , but is not so strict about using only a certain number of words. Every day, Simple English changes, and does not have only one-word list. A good starting point to writing in Simple English is to learn to write using Basic English words. This helps you to write with a smaller, controlled vocabulary . Start with Basic English (BE) 850 . Your readers may know the BE 850 words. If your writing sounds strange or is not clear, use a less common word. The less common word may be in BE 1500 or Voice Of America (VOA) Special English . Example The example below shows why we do not insist on using only Basic English words. The full English sentence is from Winston Churchill : Full English: I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat . Basic English [BE 850]: ... blood, hard work, drops from eyes, and body water. Blood is a BE 850 word. Hard work is good for those who understand English as their mother language . But a learner could understand the word hard as \"solid\" or \"difficult to understand\". Perhaps much work is better. Drops from eyes sounds strange to people whose mother language is English. Tears is a BE 1500 word, and you can use it. Body water also sounds strange to a person whose mother language is English. Sweat and perspiration both sound better. Sweat is a more common word, and you can use it by linking to the article on sweat . Often, for difficult words that are from Latin (such as \"perspiration\") there will also be a native ( Old English or Anglo-Saxon ) word such as \"sweat\" meaning the same thing that is much more common and basic, but this is not always the case. Another way is to write the more difficult words, but explain what they mean in parentheses, \" ( \" and \" ) \", if they cannot be linked.  For example, write \" blood , toil (hard work), tears , and sweat \". Method Write your words normally, as you would in speaking to ordinary people. Look for your words in the word lists. Try to use the simplest word list: In Basic English BE 850 ( pictures ) In Basic English BE 1500 . In VOA Special English Word Book . If a word is a name, idiomatic (the meaning of the words is not clear from the roots), or jargon (special words used by experts), then it should be described in more detail. Linking to an article about the word can also help. Stephen Hawking was a cosmologist —someone who studies the structure of the universe (stars and space). Not all words can have a good encyclopedia article written about them.  To link to the dictionary definition of a word rather than an encyclopedic article, link to the Simple English Wiktionary using a link like [[wikt:this | ]] (put your word in place of \"this\"). For a more complex definition, you may also link to the English Wiktionary like this: [[:en:wikt:this | ]] . Change to active voice . Example: change from \"The bird was eaten by the cat.\" ( passive voice ) to \"The cat ate the bird.\" Look for a Basic English verb in past or present only. For writing about science or trade, do as asked by the process of AECMA Simplified English (see Other websites below for International Aerospace Maintenance Language). After finishing the article, check to have at least one link (to another article in Simple English Wikipedia) and add it to Wikidata . The first is so the article is not a dead-end article, and the second is so that it gets connected to other language versions. Simple sentence structure Simple sentences are easier to understand than complex ones. The simplest sentence structure in English is subject-verb-object-period , subject-verb-object-period and so on. Try to use the simplest sentences that make sense. You should begin by writing simple sentences naturally when you add something to Simple Wikipedia. In your mind, do not phrase your sentence obscurely and then try to convert it to something simpler. Get in the habit of thinking in clear, direct English, without unnecessary words. But never be afraid to add a few words to make a sentence clearer. Simple English is not shorter English, although it frequently has shorter sentences. Often, simple English needs more words than ordinary English. Sometimes this is because of \"filler words\" (extra words), where the words act as a mental pause, allowing the reader to catch up with your thought. When changing an article from the English Wikipedia, often your Simple English article uses 25% to 50% more words than in standard English. When the original English is poorly structured, you may need much more space. Please remember to use this guideline and all Wikipedia rules with common sense . It is more important to follow the main ideas of simple sentence structure than it is to cut every possible sentence to its simplest form. Guidelines Always start by using simple sentences . For example: John Smith walked his dog. Subject : John Smith Verb : walked Direct object : his dog and John Smith walked his dog to the supermarket. Subject : John Smith Verb : walked Direct object : his dog Indirect object (also prepositional phrase): to the supermarket but, if possible, not John Smith walked to the supermarket with his dog. Subject : John Smith Verb : walked Two indirect objects referring to the subject: to the supermarket and with his dog Try to avoid compound sentences – those with embedded conjunctions (and, or, but, however, etc.) – when possible. Write this: Good : John Smith walked his dog. Later, he was tired. instead of Less good : John Smith walked his dog but later he was tired. But this is not a guideline in favor of short sentences. For example: Good : John Smith walked his big, hairy dog, Bluto, to the supermarket on Main Street. Later, he was so tired that he collapsed onto his bed exhausted. If you must use complex sentences – those with both independent clauses (which express a complete thought) and at least one subordinate clause (starting with a word like although, because, who, which, etc.) – try to have only one subordinate clause , like this: John Smith walked his dog to the supermarket because he was hungry. Subject : John Smith Verb : walked Direct object : his dog Indirect object (also prepositional phrase): to the supermarket Dependent clause : because he was hungry For example: Bad : John Smith, who was very tired, walked his dog to the supermarket because he was hungry but he returned to his home still hungry and even more tired because the market was closed. Clauses : who was very tired ; because he was hungry ; but he returned to his home ; and even more tired and because the market was closed Better : John Smith was very tired. Nevertheless, he walked his dog to the supermarket because he was hungry. But the market was closed. So he returned to his home still hungry and even more tired. Try not to use compound-complex sentences , with multiple independent and dependent clauses. Bad : John Smith walked his dog to the supermarket where he thought he might buy some apples, but Mary Jones, who considered herself superior to John (although many people believed that she didn't have any reason to feel that way), arrived first and spitefully bought the remaining three apples and so John, who was very mad at Mary by this time, had to go home hungry anyway. Better : John Smith walked his dog to the supermarket, thinking he might buy some apples. However, Mary Jones arrived first, and bought the last three. She did this just for spite. She considered herself superior to John, though many thought she had no reason to feel that way. By this time, John was very mad at Mary, but he had to go home hungry anyway. To sum up, the preferred sentence forms are: 1. Subject - Verb - DirectObject 2. Subject - Verb - IndirectObject 3. Subject - Verb - DirectObject - IndirectObject 4. Subject - Verb - DirectObject - SubordinateClause 5. Subject - Verb - DirectObject - IndirectObject - SubordinateClause Rewriting existing sentences Here are some suggestions about how to change complex sentence structures into simpler ones. They can be applied over and over again to the same sentence until you feel the sentence is simple enough for this Wikipedia. Although listed in order of complexity, the ideas can be applied in any order. Suggestions When you see and , or , but , for , so , yet and other conjunctions that link two independent thoughts in the same sentence: Remove the conjunction. Add a period at the end of the word that preceded the conjunction. Capitalize the first word that followed the conjunction. You may have to add new punctuation, usually in the second sentence. Example: John Smith walked his dog but later he was tired. becomes John Smith walked his dog. Later, he was tired. When the subject is missing from the second thought, add the appropriate pronoun . Example: John Smith walked his dog and later petted Mary's cat. becomes John Smith walked his dog. Later, he petted Mary's cat. You can always split a sentence at a semicolon . Example: John Smith liked to walk his dog ; today, however, the dog was sick. becomes John Smith liked to walk his dog. Today, however, the dog was sick. a. When the conjunction expresses significant meaning (usually how or why the subject arrived at the current state), you might consider leaving the conjunction in place as the start of the second sentence. Example: John Smith walked his dog, but he didn't like it. becomes John Smith walked his dog. But he did not like it. (here but is the conjunction that now starts the next sentence). b. You might also want to change the order of the sentences, and change the conjunction if necessary. Example: John Smith walked his dog even though he was very tired. becomes John Smith was very tired. Even so, he walked his dog. If you see more than one subordinate or dependent clause in a sentence, you can usually isolate all but one by: Changing the order of the sentences so that the most important information comes first. Starting all but the first sentence with the filler words: this or this is or this was due to and so forth. Example: John Smith walked his dog, which made him angry because the dog always cut into on-coming traffic, which, in turn, made the drivers angry at John, not the dog. becomes John Smith was angry while walking his dog. This was because the dog would always cut into on-coming traffic. This, in turn, made the drivers irritated at John, not the dog. When you see a dependent clause occurring in the middle of a sentence (normally separated by commas or parentheses), you can usually detach it and make it a separate sentence, again with the appropriate pronoun. Example: John Smith, who was very tired, walked his dog... becomes John Smith was very tired. He walked his dog... A real-world example Before changing, these two paragraphs were in the Wikipedia article on the Sun : Earth 's fate is still a bit of a mystery. Previous calculations show that due to the solar wind (which drops 30% of the sun's mass), Earth could escape to a higher orbit. But a newer study shows that, due to the tidal forces, Earth would possibly vanish itself while the sun continues to get bigger, although the sun will lose mass. Anyway, Earth's ocean and air would long have worn out, even if the sun is still in its main sequence stage. After the Sun reaches a point where it can no longer get bigger, the Sun will literally explode, but not like a supernova , but rather, it will expand rapidly and lose its layers, forming a planetary nebula . Eventually the sun will shrink into a white dwarf , and over several hundred billion, even trillion years (100,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000 years), fade to a black dwarf After changing, these paragraphs looked like this: Earth 's fate is still a bit of a mystery. In the long term, the Earth's future depends on the Sun, and the Sun is going to be fairly stable for the next 5 billion years. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Calculations suggest that the Earth might move to a wider orbit. This is because about 30% of the Sun's mass will blow away in the solar wind . However, in the very long term, the Earth will probably be destroyed as the Sun increases in size. Stars like the Sun become red giants at a later stage. [ 3 ] The Sun will expand beyond the orbits of Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth. In any event, the Earth's ocean and air would have vanished before the Sun gets to that stage. After the Sun reaches a point where it can no longer get bigger, it will lose its layers and form a planetary nebula . Eventually, the Sun will shrink into a white dwarf . Then, over several hundred billion or even a trillion years, the Sun would fade into a black dwarf . These changes were not just a matter of language. It did need some subject-matter understanding. The latest version has changes in the language, and better science, with some sources. Simple Introduction Please also read the guideline about the article's introduction which must be written in a simplified format so that readers with an English comprehension level of a student in the US grades of 7-9 can read and a non-expert in the topic can understand. What not to do Do not ... use poor grammar or incorrect spelling. use bad English: This is Simple English, not bad English. use contractions (such as I've, can't, hasn't). Instead, do use long forms as this allows learners to recognize familiar grammatical patterns. use complex sentences. use idioms (one or more words that together mean something other than what they say). use words you are not sure about without using a dictionary . write articles so short that they offer no useful information. write in the second person . Good encyclopedia articles are never addressed to \"you\". Do not make statements about \"you\". put links in titles (or other elements that structure the article). Try to keep the navigation and the structure of an article separate. just copy a whole article from the normal English Wikipedia and leave it like that without simplifying it.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Wikipedia:How to write Simple English articles ) This page is a guideline on the Simple English Wikipedia. Many editors agree with the ideas on this page. It is a good idea to follow it, but it is not policy . You can change the page as needed, but please use the talk page to make sure that other editors agree with any big changes. Shortcuts : WP:HOW WP:COMPLEX This page tells how to write articles in Simple English . Articles in Simple English Wikipedia are for everyone. This includes children and adults who are learning English. Articles should be about notable encyclopedic subjects. Think about our readers First, think about our readers. Many readers of Simple English are people whose first language is not English. Other readers may be young (they may be children who do not have much knowledge of English ) or have learning difficulties . The language is simple, but the ideas do not have to be. If you find anything wrong, please correct it. Basic English and VOA Special English Simple English Wikipedia follows some of the rules of Basic English , but is not so strict about using only a certain number of words. Every day, Simple English changes, and does not have only one-word list. A good starting point to writing in Simple English is to learn to write using Basic English words. This helps you to write with a smaller, controlled vocabulary . Start with Basic English (BE) 850 . Your readers may know the BE 850 words. If your writing sounds strange or is not clear, use a less common word. The less common word may be in BE 1500 or Voice Of America (VOA) Special English . Example The example below shows why we do not insist on using only Basic English words. The full English sentence is from Winston Churchill : Full English: I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat . Basic English [BE 850]: ... blood, hard work, drops from eyes, and body water. Blood is a BE 850 word. Hard work is good for those who understand English as their mother language . But a learner could understand the word hard as \"solid\" or \"difficult to understand\". Perhaps much work is better. Drops from eyes sounds strange to people whose mother language is English. Tears is a BE 1500 word, and you can use it. Body water also sounds strange to a person whose mother language is English. Sweat and perspiration both sound better. Sweat is a more common word, and you can use it by linking to the article on sweat . Often, for difficult words that are from Latin (such as \"perspiration\") there will also be a native ( Old English or Anglo-Saxon ) word such as \"sweat\" meaning the same thing that is much more common and basic, but this is not always the case. Another way is to write the more difficult words, but explain what they mean in parentheses, \" ( \" and \" ) \", if they cannot be linked.  For example, write \" blood , toil (hard work), tears , and sweat \". Method Write your words normally, as you would in speaking to ordinary people. Look for your words in the word lists. Try to use the simplest word list: In Basic English BE 850 ( pictures ) In Basic English BE 1500 . In VOA Special English Word Book . If a word is a name, idiomatic (the meaning of the words is not clear from the roots), or jargon (special words used by experts), then it should be described in more detail. Linking to an article about the word can also help. Stephen Hawking was a cosmologist —someone who studies the structure of the universe (stars and space). Not all words can have a good encyclopedia article written about them.  To link to the dictionary definition of a word rather than an encyclopedic article, link to the Simple English Wiktionary using a link like [[wikt:this | ]] (put your word in place of \"this\"). For a more complex definition, you may also link to the English Wiktionary like this: [[:en:wikt:this | ]] . Change to active voice . Example: change from \"The bird was eaten by the cat.\" ( passive voice ) to \"The cat ate the bird.\" Look for a Basic English verb in past or present only. For writing about science or trade, do as asked by the process of AECMA Simplified English (see Other websites below for International Aerospace Maintenance Language). After finishing the article, check to have at least one link (to another article in Simple English Wikipedia) and add it to Wikidata . The first is so the article is not a dead-end article, and the second is so that it gets connected to other language versions. Simple sentence structure Simple sentences are easier to understand than complex ones. The simplest sentence structure in English is subject-verb-object-period , subject-verb-object-period and so on. Try to use the simplest sentences that make sense. You should begin by writing simple sentences naturally when you add something to Simple Wikipedia. In your mind, do not phrase your sentence obscurely and then try to convert it to something simpler. Get in the habit of thinking in clear, direct English, without unnecessary words. But never be afraid to add a few words to make a sentence clearer. Simple English is not shorter English, although it frequently has shorter sentences. Often, simple English needs more words than ordinary English. Sometimes this is because of \"filler words\" (extra words), where the words act as a mental pause, allowing the reader to catch up with your thought. When changing an article from the English Wikipedia, often your Simple English article uses 25% to 50% more words than in standard English. When the original English is poorly structured, you may need much more space. Please remember to use this guideline and all Wikipedia rules with common sense . It is more important to follow the main ideas of simple sentence structure than it is to cut every possible sentence to its simplest form. Guidelines Always start by using simple sentences . For example: John Smith walked his dog. Subject : John Smith Verb : walked Direct object : his dog and John Smith walked his dog to the supermarket. Subject : John Smith Verb : walked Direct object : his dog Indirect object (also prepositional phrase): to the supermarket but, if possible, not John Smith walked to the supermarket with his dog. Subject : John Smith Verb : walked Two indirect objects referring to the subject: to the supermarket and with his dog Try to avoid compound sentences – those with embedded conjunctions (and, or, but, however, etc.) – when possible. Write this: Good : John Smith walked his dog. Later, he was tired. instead of Less good : John Smith walked his dog but later he was tired. But this is not a guideline in favor of short sentences. For example: Good : John Smith walked his big, hairy dog, Bluto, to the supermarket on Main Street. Later, he was so tired that he collapsed onto his bed exhausted. If you must use complex sentences – those with both independent clauses (which express a complete thought) and at least one subordinate clause (starting with a word like although, because, who, which, etc.) – try to have only one subordinate clause , like this: John Smith walked his dog to the supermarket because he was hungry. Subject : John Smith Verb : walked Direct object : his dog Indirect object (also prepositional phrase): to the supermarket Dependent clause : because he was hungry For example: Bad : John Smith, who was very tired, walked his dog to the supermarket because he was hungry but he returned to his home still hungry and even more tired because the market was closed. Clauses : who was very tired ; because he was hungry ; but he returned to his home ; and even more tired and because the market was closed Better : John Smith was very tired. Nevertheless, he walked his dog to the supermarket because he was hungry. But the market was closed. So he returned to his home still hungry and even more tired. Try not to use compound-complex sentences , with multiple independent and dependent clauses. Bad : John Smith walked his dog to the supermarket where he thought he might buy some apples, but Mary Jones, who considered herself superior to John (although many people believed that she didn't have any reason to feel that way), arrived first and spitefully bought the remaining three apples and so John, who was very mad at Mary by this time, had to go home hungry anyway. Better : John Smith walked his dog to the supermarket, thinking he might buy some apples. However, Mary Jones arrived first, and bought the last three. She did this just for spite. She considered herself superior to John, though many thought she had no reason to feel that way. By this time, John was very mad at Mary, but he had to go home hungry anyway. To sum up, the preferred sentence forms are: 1. Subject - Verb - DirectObject 2. Subject - Verb - IndirectObject 3. Subject - Verb - DirectObject - IndirectObject 4. Subject - Verb - DirectObject - SubordinateClause 5. Subject - Verb - DirectObject - IndirectObject - SubordinateClause Rewriting existing sentences Here are some suggestions about how to change complex sentence structures into simpler ones. They can be applied over and over again to the same sentence until you feel the sentence is simple enough for this Wikipedia. Although listed in order of complexity, the ideas can be applied in any order. Suggestions When you see and , or , but , for , so , yet and other conjunctions that link two independent thoughts in the same sentence: Remove the conjunction. Add a period at the end of the word that preceded the conjunction. Capitalize the first word that followed the conjunction. You may have to add new punctuation, usually in the second sentence. Example: John Smith walked his dog but later he was tired. becomes John Smith walked his dog. Later, he was tired. When the subject is missing from the second thought, add the appropriate pronoun . Example: John Smith walked his dog and later petted Mary's cat. becomes John Smith walked his dog. Later, he petted Mary's cat. You can always split a sentence at a semicolon . Example: John Smith liked to walk his dog ; today, however, the dog was sick. becomes John Smith liked to walk his dog. Today, however, the dog was sick. a. When the conjunction expresses significant meaning (usually how or why the subject arrived at the current state), you might consider leaving the conjunction in place as the start of the second sentence. Example: John Smith walked his dog, but he didn't like it. becomes John Smith walked his dog. But he did not like it. (here but is the conjunction that now starts the next sentence). b. You might also want to change the order of the sentences, and change the conjunction if necessary. Example: John Smith walked his dog even though he was very tired. becomes John Smith was very tired. Even so, he walked his dog. If you see more than one subordinate or dependent clause in a sentence, you can usually isolate all but one by: Changing the order of the sentences so that the most important information comes first. Starting all but the first sentence with the filler words: this or this is or this was due to and so forth. Example: John Smith walked his dog, which made him angry because the dog always cut into on-coming traffic, which, in turn, made the drivers angry at John, not the dog. becomes John Smith was angry while walking his dog. This was because the dog would always cut into on-coming traffic. This, in turn, made the drivers irritated at John, not the dog. When you see a dependent clause occurring in the middle of a sentence (normally separated by commas or parentheses), you can usually detach it and make it a separate sentence, again with the appropriate pronoun. Example: John Smith, who was very tired, walked his dog... becomes John Smith was very tired. He walked his dog... A real-world example Before changing, these two paragraphs were in the Wikipedia article on the Sun : Earth 's fate is still a bit of a mystery. Previous calculations show that due to the solar wind (which drops 30% of the sun's mass), Earth could escape to a higher orbit. But a newer study shows that, due to the tidal forces, Earth would possibly vanish itself while the sun continues to get bigger, although the sun will lose mass. Anyway, Earth's ocean and air would long have worn out, even if the sun is still in its main sequence stage. After the Sun reaches a point where it can no longer get bigger, the Sun will literally explode, but not like a supernova , but rather, it will expand rapidly and lose its layers, forming a planetary nebula . Eventually the sun will shrink into a white dwarf , and over several hundred billion, even trillion years (100,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000 years), fade to a black dwarf After changing, these paragraphs looked like this: Earth 's fate is still a bit of a mystery. In the long term, the Earth's future depends on the Sun, and the Sun is going to be fairly stable for the next 5 billion years. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Calculations suggest that the Earth might move to a wider orbit. This is because about 30% of the Sun's mass will blow away in the solar wind . However, in the very long term, the Earth will probably be destroyed as the Sun increases in size. Stars like the Sun become red giants at a later stage. [ 3 ] The Sun will expand beyond the orbits of Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth. In any event, the Earth's ocean and air would have vanished before the Sun gets to that stage. After the Sun reaches a point where it can no longer get bigger, it will lose its layers and form a planetary nebula . Eventually, the Sun will shrink into a white dwarf . Then, over several hundred billion or even a trillion years, the Sun would fade into a black dwarf . These changes were not just a matter of language. It did need some subject-matter understanding. The latest version has changes in the language, and better science, with some sources. Simple Introduction Please also read the guideline about the article's introduction which must be written in a simplified format so that readers with an English comprehension level of a student in the US grades of 7-9 can read and a non-expert in the topic can understand. What not to do Do not ... use poor grammar or incorrect spelling. use bad English: This is Simple English, not bad English. use contractions (such as I've, can't, hasn't). Instead, do use long forms as this allows learners to recognize familiar grammatical patterns. use complex sentences. use idioms (one or more words that together mean something other than what they say). use words you are not sure about without using a dictionary . write articles so short that they offer no useful information. write in the second person . Good encyclopedia articles are never addressed to \"you\". Do not make statements about \"you\". put links in titles (or other elements that structure the article). Try to keep the navigation and the structure of an article separate. just copy a whole article from the normal English Wikipedia and leave it like that without simplifying it. If you do not simplify it, it will be difficult to understand, and is likely to be quickly deleted .

Selected article Powderfinger is a rock band from Brisbane , Australia . The band started in 1989. Powderfinger has five members; Bernard Fanning ( sings , plays guitar ), Darren Middleton (plays guitar), Ian Haug (plays guitar), John Collins (plays bass guitar ), and Jon Coghill (plays drums ). After some extended plays (EPs) that sold quite well, and making one full album, Powderfinger became popular in Australia with their second album; Double Allergic . Their third album, Internationalist , was even more popular and made them celebrities . It sold over 350,000 copies. Odyssey Number Five was their fourth album and was released in 2000. It is their most famous album; it was sold overseas in the United States and Canada . Powderfinger's next two albums were not as popular as the earlier ones, but still got to number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) charts . more...

No further edits should be made to this discussion. Result -This page should be archived; there's a bot conmfiguation at the top of this page; bots should honor it, and archive discussions accodingly. Setup or archival should be the same as the other pages that get archives, such as Simple talk, or admin noticeboard. Specific archival settings are different.-- Eptalon ( talk ) 20:08, 13 May 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] This is an RfC to archive this page. The BRFA for Bot873 excludes anything outside of user talk pages and admin related pages (decided on by the admins). Above, we had a discussion to change the settings for the archiving of this page, without realizing this page (and namespace) was purposefully excluded by the operator due to policy on requiring consensus for any public page that is outside the above named \"namespaces.\" The current settings for this page archiving is as follows: Archive any discussion that has not been edited in the last 45 days (using the last time stamp in the discussion) Must leave the last three (3) discussions (regardless of how old) on the page. Please feel free to leave your comments or !votes in the appropriate sections below. Support Support as nominator Thanks, and be well! - PDL Talk to me! Please don't eat da 🐑! 09:26, 12 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Support It's common sense - archiving Talk:Main Page is the same procedure as archiving simple talk or noticeboards. Kk.urban ( talk ) 16:15, 12 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Support 45 days is quite fast though, and we'd need more than 3 posts remaining. This page really isn't active enough to the point we should be emptying this out. -- Ferien ( talk ) 20:07, 27 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Oppose Discussion and questions This RfC is scheduled to close on Thursday, April 25, 2024 at 20:53 (UTC) The above discussion is preserved as an archive . Please do not change it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page, such as the current discussion page. No more changes should be made to this discussion. Neptune On the front page as of now, the picture is different. I've seen this happen before, but I was ignored. In the article, they use a completely different picture rather than the one of the front page. LOLHWAT ( talk ) 11:42, 16 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ LOLHWAT I believe it picks a random picture from the article. Thanks, and be well! - PDL Talk to me! Please don't eat da 🐑! 11:50, 17 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ PotsdamLamb and LOLHWAT : The article previews on the main page come from subpages of Wikipedia:Very good articles . For example, this one is at Wikipedia:Very good articles/Neptune . These do not update automatically so they have to be updated by a person, when the article is changed. About the picture of Neptune: I liked the one on the front page better, but sadly, it's a false color image, so we should probably update it to use the true color image that's displayed on Neptune . Kk.urban ( talk ) 19:21, 17 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] English: Uploader's notes: The original NASA/Cowart PNG image has been modified by flattening (combining layers), cropping and converting to JPEG format. Original caption released with image: Voyager 2 Narrow Angle Camera image of Neptune taken on August 20, 1989 as the spacecraft approached the planet for a flyby on August 25. The Great Dark Spot, flanked by cirrus clouds, is at center. A smaller dark storm, Dark Spot Jr., is rotating into view at bottom left. Additionally, a patch of white cirrus clouds to its north, named \"Scooter\" for its rapid motion relative to other features, is visible. This image was constructed using orange, green and synthetic violet (50/50 blend of green filter and UV filter images) taken between 626 and 643 UT.

LOLHWAT ( talk ) 22:03, 17 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Inquiry How many articles are there in Simple Wikipedia? Brick No.2 ( talk ) 06:08, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Special:Statistics says there are slighlty more than 254.000 \"content pages\". I guess that includes the \"Wikipedia:\" namespace, which is mostly about coordinating the project. There are likely less than 50 pages there, so it doesn't really influence the count. Eptalon ( talk ) 07:02, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Why did you add the decimal point? Or was it a typo (meaning the number would be 254 000 Brick No.2 ( talk ) 09:05, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] The thousands separator is either a full stop (.), a comma (,) or a space. Eptalon ( talk ) 09:11, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Is that a foreign thing or something? In Australia the full stop isn't used to separate thousands - or at least I don't think so. There is a chance that I am wrong. Brick No.2 ( talk ) 09:17, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] It is one of the things that are also part of Internationalisation (I18N) that are often forgotten. It varies by counrty.-- Eptalon ( talk ) 07:56, 1 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Best way to use a fair use non free EN wiki file here? Trying to update a article the  English wiki has one but its fair use and tried using it here and it did not work and could not find a way to upload other than commons but they do not accept non free files what is the best way is it to link to URL of the the EN wiki file  or link to the URL official image? Commons does not have a similar file. Isla ( talk ) 11:54, 25 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ Isla : At this time, it is not possible to do that. As it happens, there is a current discussion about this at Wikipedia:Simple_talk#Non-free_images . By the way, please use WP:Simple talk for questions like this. The page we're on is for discussing the main page. Thanks. -- Auntof6 ( talk ) 04:38, 26 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Unfortunately there is no such way because Simple is still stuck in 2004. – Davey 2010 Talk 14:18, 26 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Removal/change of Wikispecies URL The species:Main Page (Simple English) page that the Wikispecies URL redirects to has been deleted over at Wikispecies for the reason, Per similar other multilingual projects, there is no need for an explicitly simple English page here. It may be appropriate to move it down to \"In Regular English:\" and point the URL at species:Main Page ? Ternera ( talk ) 16:03, 25 September 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I've pointed the URL to species:Main Page , I haven't moved it for now as I think (not 100% certain) it's referring to the project in general. For example, Wikidata is on there even though it doesn't have a Simple English specific Main Page. Looking at some random Wikispecies pages, I believe they are reasonably simple for our readers to understand. -- Ferien ( talk ) 16:22, 25 September 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Retrieved from \" https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page&oldid=9816698 \" Hidden categories: Wikipedia semi-protected talk pages Pages using Template:Annual readership This page was last changed on 9 October 2024, at 05:30.

Add this page to your list of watched pages — Purge change Country-musicians *raised* in 'a state of the United States' [ change source ] There were some \"List of country musicians from 'state in the United States']], that were deleted some years ago.--Those, and List of country musicians from California , have little interest, to me. (\"Never-ending\" discussions about the meaning of 'from', is not my cup of tea.) However, List of country musicians raised in Texas , is a list that i might start.--If a person was raised in two or more states, then I am fine with just having that person in \"Related pages\", or (much less likely) section \"Raised in different states\". List of country musicians from California , has some names that 'could end up on two lists'.--However, I am not planning on starting, \"List of country musicians raised in California\".--Is there anything more to say then, except: if there are too many protests about \"my\" list, then it will get taken to AfD?--Remember also to give thanks to those who do a lot of work with categories. 2001:2020:341:DA4B:F071:D4FE:8575:D928 ( talk ) 23:01, 25 September 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Kris Kristofferson (d. 2024), has 'always' been on the 'California list' (because he was raised there).--When any 'Texas list' gets created - then how does one avoid him being 'Listed on two similar lists'? The following could be mentioned on 'the (upcoming) Texas list', \"* Kris Kristoffersen [not blue-linked]\" ,see List of country musicians raised in California \" In that way, Kristoffersen 'is only on one list (California)' (and the few people that know that Kristoffersen was born in Texas, will find his name, and see which 'one list that Kristoffersen really belongs to'. Note: there is no list here called, \"List of ... born in California\"). \" Raised in California\", is part of topic \" From Californa\". (Would anyone argue \"No\", to that point?) 2001:2020:355:C958:1431:DC72:A783:3460 ( talk ) 02:40, 1 October 2024 (UTC) / 02:35, 1 October 2024 (UTC) /2001:2020:341:DA4B:F071:D4FE:8575:D928 [ reply ] List of country musicians from Texas .

No need for an extra classification. Eptalon ( talk ) 21:07, 12 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] List of country musicians from Texas , seems to not have \"your\" concerns/problems.--If you think that the article should be deleted, then you might want to nominate it for Delete.--If you have an example of anyone who is on the wrong list, then i suggest that you take up the matter on the talk page of 'musicians from that state'.--One person should only be linked from one list (and I can not see any problem yet, now that Kristoffersen seems to 'be on only one page'). 2001:2020:341:B0D8:49A7:52CE:A985:441A ( talk ) 04:48, 13 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I don't see any benefits to change things to other than there are now. fr33k man 06:03, 13 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] It would be a benifit that we get things right, in regard to cases such as this composer of Take It Easy , so that they do not get passed off as a European country-musician (or German, since he was born there, but raised in California).--En-wiki has gotten the category right, i feel.--The way that (relevant) articles, are today - seems largely okay.--Time to let this thread, Just Fade Away . 2001:2020:333:C6E5:83A:C472:2680:1408 ( talk ) 19:55, 18 October 2024 (UTC) /2001:2020:341:B0D8:49A7:52CE:A985:441A [ reply ] I think the question should also be, if it is practical: Yes, most people were born elsewhee, and raisen somewhere.

I would therefore propose we set up the bot to also archive them automatically; proposed parameters: 10d old, min 2 threads left. Comments?

MathXplore ( talk ) 00:32, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Considering how RfCU works, I would want to see the bot be tested in a RfCU replica before firmly saying yay or nay.- FusionSub ( Talk page ) ( Contributions ) 10:28, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Pure Evil offered a reasonable point at Wikipedia talk:Requests for checkuser#Archiving 2 . I feel like it is probably best for CUs to manually review each one prior to it going to the archived, as responses can often go unanswered - and I appreciate sometimes this is on purpose. -- Ferien ( talk ) 16:00, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Idk, I'm 50:50 on this one. It'd be nice to have them auto archived due to workload issues but understand the issues of wanting to manually close them out. I'd lean towards a bot if it could be made to work. fr33k man 18:42, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] i think the bot handling the other page archiving could be made to work. It would archive discussions that haven't Bern touched in ..  days, leaving at least ... Items on the page? Eptalon ( talk ) 19:48, 7 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I would leave it to the people with the checkuser right to decide, but I have a question. Is there an amount of time an unaddressed request can be left, after which either it is considered stale or the checkusers wouldn't do anything with it? I would let that be the number of days old to use for archiving. -- Auntof6 ( talk ) 06:56, 10 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] ( Non-checkuser observation ) @ Auntof6 : m:CheckUser_policy#CheckUser_status says information is only stored for a short period (currently 90 days) , so I think this is the time limit. MathXplore ( talk ) 07:07, 10 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] As to the data availability: requests need to be made fairly quickly, information that is older than about three months is deleted. As you requests: I would guess s bot could (technically) handle archiving old requests.... Eptalon ( talk ) 23:04, 10 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] ┌─────────────────────────────────┘ I found C:User:SpBot/How to make SpBot archive your wiki that looks like it could help with this. A note on C:Commons talk:WikiProject Heraldry and vexillology , which the bot archives, says that it archives 1) any section tagged as resolved and 2) any section whose most recent comment is older than 90 days. Of course, maybe our usual archiving bot can do the same thing. -- Auntof6 ( talk ) 13:04, 11 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Template:Langx [ change source ] I was expanding features on {{ Langx }} .

Batrachoseps ( talk ) 18:44, 9 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I think we should match en and have it so tropical cyclone contains the main details, but they are also branched off into Atlantic hurricane and typhoon .

Template:Clothing ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Crowns ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Hats ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Headgear ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Helmets ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) Template:Historical clothing ( edit · talk · history · links · watch · logs · delete ) These templates: Have a large number of links, mostly red but some with a fair number of blue Are all clothing-related Are transcluded on one page (the historical clothing one) or no pages Except for the historical clothing one, were created by a user who appeared to be creating templates because they appeared in wanted templates. However, the only places that used them were lists of related templates on template doc pages. I was about to start adding these to the blue-linked pages, but I thought it was worth discussing first. The reason I am putting these up for discussion is that they would take up more space in an article than the article text on most of the articles that are blue-linked. Are we okay with having navboxes that overwhelm the body of an article? There are probably more templates with the same issue, but this is a small group of related ones that I happened to see around the same time. Please do not add these to articles until we have a chance to have this discussion, so that that we won't have to remove them again later. Thanks. -- Auntof6 ( talk ) 12:19, 11 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Templates that have been imported from English-wiki - i have always found them helpful ( even if there are only two blue-links and say 98 red -links.)--I am not trying to be rude when i am saying this.--Do i think that it would be helpful to have a three blue -link limit (for templates)? No, i would be against that.--Remotely related: Would it be against wiki-regulations if I go to, say user talk:Aunty of 5,6,7 or to user talk:Epptalonn, and ask: Do you think this is an acceptable sub-stub about Golden hat (headwear) \"blah-blah-blah\".--Anyway, I would like to ask original poster which of the templates is the first one that she would 'recommend et cetera', that should be nominated for Delete.

Cosm Learner ( talk ) contribs 21:32, 11 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] There should not be that kind of link to any other Wikipedia.

He's simply just abusing his power and removing all of my content specifically, and deleting massive amounts of information from the website. That's why I think he is wrong - Wikipedia is a place for information, and that means all of it. I will do my best to link the parts of my talk page where he has commented, both today and in the past (wherein he deleted massive amounts of content from the website). Any undo to his edits and he instantly reverts it, removing this content and giving the reason that it is 'nonsense' in his opinion. Here are the links I will try to paste where hopefully you can see that it is repetitive and targeted deletions: https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:W;ChangingUsername&action=edit&section=11 https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:W;ChangingUsername&action=edit&section=9 He doesn't or can't warn me 'as per' en:WP:DTTR in either because there's no grounds for it. He is only allowed because of his position, over me, which shouldn't matter in the context of putting information on this site. In another simple_talk entry, he deletes a ton of other content en-mass and throughout nearly all of the articles I have pasted from the NHS website to here. If this goes through then I will work on putting the pages back as I come across them (and I will hopefully be able to create more, so that simple_wikipedia is more full (which is what it should be about!) but (again) if this goes through then it would be probably best for someone with the ability to scan through mass content and correcting his actions to do it, because it is on a lot of the site throughout the content, and I believe it is vandalism. Tagging the user other so that he may be present: @ Davey2010 W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 15:26, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ Eptalon was my helper, I think. And I would like to point out that a majority of the pages I've created thus far have been categorized on the external wikilinks page, for simple_wikipedia, and that the information in the pages have been deleted, but previously would of been a link to this website with a more full page. And that way might be the only way for the person there to get it - but now, it is gone His contributions are Thomas the Tank Engine and Paw Patrol, and some really bad / low quality page on lymes disease and/or I think strokes, which didn't, and still don't ( because he reverts all edits done to the page ) in my opinion meet Wikipedias standards in a few ways. That and of course removing tons of content from the site. There is nothing wrong with the content on those pages, and here I am contesting - specifically or as an example - and would like to contest this decision of this 'insane' edit the page of course being Cinnarizine. There is NO content on this page anymore, after his edits - look at how many he cut out, and look at how much there is now. Does THIS still meet the standards, and is it a better page now than it was before? His edits are simply not good. W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 15:33, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] 1). I'm not a mod or an admin and I've never said otherwise. 2). \" I have pasted from the NHS website to here. \" ... which is a Copyright violation and isn't allowed, 3). There was consensus here to delete the GUIDE stuff you spammed everywhere. 4). I stated here \" No consensus for these edits, Why would you reinstate content that had consensus to be deleted (at the prev editsum) ?\" so why would you ignore that and post the same content back 3 months later ?, 5). The DTTR was me treating you with respect and not templating you to death - I hate when people do this to me so I was trying to be more polite and approachable to you so your \" because there's no grounds for it \" is ludicrous and silly. 6). Have you actually looked at the issues at Thomas the Tank Engine and Paw Patrol ? ... If you had you would've known those articles have been magnets for either deliberately fake information or unsourced edits, I don't revert people for the sake of it believe you me. 7). You can contest my blanking as much as you like but my edits/blanking was following our core policy; WP:COPYVIO as well as following the consensus for removing this content here . – Davey 2010 Talk 15:46, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Hi, W;ChangingUsername . I highly doubt Davey2010 was vandalising. First, there needs to be consensus about the part that you're trying to put in . Also, simply removing some parts of an article isn't vandalism unless it's removing helpful edits to Wikipedia. In this case, it's not vandalism. Also, this article still does meet the standards; it's just a stub and can be gradually worked on. Thanks, Aster 🪻 talk edits 15:47, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] If you really feel this way then I would like to resolve the issues you have with me or my content before I proceed to edit in more pages to the website, so that this doesn't keep happening (because right now I feel like it will) I think the page follows rules, and if the rules disagree with that then maybe they are wrong, and should be challenged, to allow that content. That is for something to be there until people can work on it, so they can work off that instead of working off it being a stub. And there was consensus. There was a discussion about that and a lot of people agreed, but I didn't see (outside of the original responder) the outcome of the discussion, but people supported it. I would like to know. W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 15:50, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ W;ChangingUsername , It doesn't follow any rules because you've taken the content from https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/cinnarizine/side-effects-of-cinnarizine/ which is obviously a copyright violation and isn't allowed. Auntof6 is an admin and is extremely knowledgeable with policies here and they supported the removal of the content, Yes another editor supported leaving it but that's all moot now because you've admitted it was a copyright violation, That all being said en:Cinnarizine has Side Effects in sentence form so I'd be happy for side effects to be included back HOWEVER don't just undo and readd that content back as you've taken it from the NHS - You need to reword it and jumble these up if that makes sense. – Davey 2010 Talk 16:06, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] So I can add a section for 'side effects?' And the content on that website is free to use and share. There's no copyright on the website other than what should be 'free use' and could be added to Wikipedia alongside the other content which is taken from the same website? @ Auntof6 And at the same time, I can go ahead and add more to Wikipedia, but not copyright content. Or rewriting the content as I do (which I wanted to avoid, to not un-simplify it) W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 16:27, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Yep you could add a list of side effects providing it's reliably sourced, You cannot use any of the text/sentences off of the NHS website, it's best to write yhis yourself. Thanks (submitted using mobile so apologies ive done anything incorrect, Thanks) – Davey 2010 Talk 17:39, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Thanks for resolving this issue with me. I'll get on doing that later, after trying some rewording out and getting the go-ahead so that I don't make it wrong. And thanks for helping me take steps in resolving my problems that I had with you W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 11:19, 16 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] And I would guess that the NHS website is not copyright and I believe the content is free to use - if it were, the edits would be fine to be on this website then? W;ChangingUsername W;ChangingUsername Firstly, Davey2010 is not an admin. You are adding medical instructions to the page, you are editwarring, you are breaking copyright by copying NHS information and breaking other rules. Right now you are in the wrong and close to a block. Work with other people not against them. fr33k man 16:05, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] If the content was not copyrighted (like before) Or, if I got permission from the website (NHS) owners and UK government to use the content, then would the information remain on simple_wikipedia ? I mean if permission was gained, the edits would go back. W;ChangingUsername ( talk ) 16:31, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] With your second case here, due to how the licence that Wikipedia uses works ( CC-BY-SA ), that would still be considered copyright infringement in the eyes of our policies (and possibly the law).- FusionSub ( Talk page ) ( Contributions ) 16:36, 14 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] OK, understood.

Cosm Learner ( talk ) contribs 11:57, 17 October 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Chemistry (\"It is a solid.\") [ change source ] It is not enough, for an encyclopedia to say, that a compound, is \"a solid\"; In many cases it should be okay to indicate something like , \"It is a solid at room temperature at atmospheric- pressure at sea level, and in many other situations\". There should be consensus as to one or more standard phrases et cetera, about what to say about those compounds. Thoughts? For now, i don't think it is helpful to use the wiki-article Standard temperature and pressure - to explain (or link), to explain 'a solid at room-temperature at sea-level (pressure)'.
