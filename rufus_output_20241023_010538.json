The table below, however, excludes 13 Wikipedias that were closed and moved to the Wikimedia Incubator for further development, leaving a current total of 339 active Wikipedias. Content in other languages is being developed at the Wikimedia Incubator; languages which meet certain criteria can get their own wikis . The table entries are ordered by current article count. Each entry gives the language name in English (linked to the English Wikipedia article for the language); its \"local name\" (i.e. in the language itself, linked to the article in that language's wiki); the language code used in the wiki's URL address and in interwiki links to it (linked to the local Main Page); and statistics on articles, edits, administrators, users, active users, and images (each linked to an appropriate local special page). To start a Wikipedia in a new language, please see our language proposal policy and the Incubator manual . Note: Just adding a link here does not create a new Wikipedia, nor does it serve to request that one be created. If a wiki becomes active and is not listed here, please post a notice on this article's talk page , including a link to all the relevant Wikipedia pages, and help promote the effort by announcing it on the Wikipedia-L mailing list, and at Wikimedia News . The tables here are maintained automatically based on statistics collected by a bot four times a day, so it is not necessary to \"manually\" update the table. (The way this is being done makes that impossible, anyway.) If something is wrong with an entry other than simply having slightly outdated statistics, post about it on the talk page . More lists of Wikipedias by various criteria : [ edit ] List of Wikipedias by article count , users , file count and depth and its source (both updated every 6 hours) List of Wikipedias by edits per article and depth (both updated every 6 hours) List of Wikipedias by language group and family (both updated every 6 hours) and language families as a tree (not just Wikipedias) List of Wikipedias by country (updated manually) List of Wikipedias by speakers per article (updated every 6 hours) List of Wikipedias by sample of articles and expanded sample of articles (both updated monthly) List of Wikipedias by featured and good articles (both updated manually) List of Wikipedias by creation date (incomplete) List of Wikipedias in multiple writing systems List of Wikipedias having local media files and zero local media files (both updated manually) List of Wikipedia milestones or en:Wikipedia:Milestone statistics (tracking of major article-count milestones) List of largest wikis (not just Wikimedia wikis) Wikimedia News (announcements and tracking of milestones for all Wikimedia projects) Tell us about your Wikipedia Notes The \" All pages \" column refers to the number of pages in all namespaces, including both articles (the official article count of each wiki) and non-articles (user pages, images, talk pages, \"project\" pages, categories, and templates). \" Active Users \" are registered users who have made at least one edit in the last thirty days. \" Files \" is the number of locally uploaded files. Note that some large Wikipedias do not use local images or other media files and rely on Commons completely, so the value \"0\" is not a glitch (see also List of Wikipedias having zero local media files ). All Wikipedias ordered by number of articles The languages listed here are Wikipedias that have been created as separate subdomains of wikipedia.org, ordered by number of articles . The table can also be sorted by other columns. It excludes closed Wikipedias . Historical data of this table dating back to 2007 can be found in the history of this table (or, after 15 October 2022, in the history of the current source of the data ). These statistics are updated nine times a day. See commons:Data:Wikipedia statistics/data.tab for the date/time of last update. (If reloading this page doesn't update the numbers to what is seen at Commons, try purging the cache .) № Language Language (local) Wiki Articles All pages Edits Admins Users Active users Files Depth

the Wikimedia Incubator for new language versions (known as \"tests\") that may become stand-alone wikis in the future. See the Incubator Manual and FAQ for more information. Manually maintained list of test Wikipedias in the Incubator Search for a wiki in over 400 different languages (includes normal Wikipedias and test Wikipedias) Closed and read-only These Wikipedias are closed and in read-only status. Existing users can still log in and their user preferences are still effective, but they cannot edit any pages. Editiable copies of these Wikipedias can be found in the Incubator; for example, the page cho:Chahta at the closed Choctaw Wikipedia can be found (and edited) at incubator:Wp/cho/Chahta . aa: – The Afar Wikipedia was closed on 10 May 2008 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/aa . ak: – The Akan Wikipedia was closed on 1 April 2023 . It should be noted that Akan is now considered a family of languages, so the ak.wikipedia domain has been split into two separate projects (and potentially more): one for Twi at tw: , and another for Fante at fat: . cho: – The Choctaw Wikipedia was closed on 3 July 2007 , following a community vote. It is now found at incubator:Wp/cho . ho: – The Hiri Motu Wikipedia was closed on 9 July 2007 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/ho . hz: – The Herero Wikipedia was closed on 24 July 2007 . The wiki has been emptied and locked, but the original user pages still exist. It is now found at incubator:Wp/hz . ii: – The Yi Wikipedia was closed on 29 July 2007 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/ii . kj: – The Kwanyama Wikipedia was closed on 10 July 2007 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/kj . kr: – The Kanuri Wikipedia was closed on 3 May 2007 , following a community vote. The reason was the absence of both content and community. It is now found at incubator:Wp/kr . lrc: – The Northern Luri Wikipedia was closed on 14 January 2021 . As almost all of the former contents were confirmed not written in proper Luri, they were not imported back into the Incubator. Users who speak the language are encouraged to re-start a test project . mh: – The Marshallese Wikipedia was closed on 4 May 2008 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/mh . mus: – The Muscogee Wikipedia was closed on 10 July 2007 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/mus . na: – The Nauruan Wikipedia was closed on 1 May 2023 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/na . ng: – The Ndonga Wikipedia was closed on 10 January 2010 . It is now found at incubator:Wp/ng . See also our Special:SiteMatrix , where the closed Wikipedias are crossed out (and the red links indicate wikis that have never existed). There is also a configuration file listing all closed Wikimedia projects . Deleted but hosted elsewhere These Wikipedias are no longer hosted by Wikimedia. They have been moved to other hosts. tok: – The Toki Pona Wikipedia was officially closed in 2008 and all projects in that language were deleted in 2010 due to the lack of a valid ISO language code at the time. The wiki was hosted by Wikia (which became Fandom ) until 2021. It is now an independently hosted encyclopedia at https://wikipesija.org . tlh: – The Klingon Wikipedia was permanently locked in August 2005, and was moved to Wikia (Fandom) as the Klingon Wiki . For details, see the history of the Klingon Wikipedia . ru-sib: – The Siberian Wikipedia was deleted in 2007 after it became apparent that the creation of the wiki in 2006 was based on a hoax. The wiki's content was moved to the sibvolgota ( archive link ). mo: – The Moldovan Wikipedia in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet was deleted in November 2017 , a decade after being closed . It is now hosted by Fandom as Википедия . The mo: interlanguage prefix now points to the Romanian Wikipedia. Nonstandard language codes These Wikipedias use language codes that do not conform to the ISO 639 standard (which is how wiki subdomains are chosen nowadays). als: – originally used for the Alsatian Wikipedia, which now encompasses the Alemannic dialects in general — the official code gsw is being considered as a replacement subdomain (note that als officially represents the unrelated language Tosk Albanian ) bat-smg: – invented code used for the Samogitian Wikipedia (not the official code sgs ) be-tarask: – invented code used for the Belarusian (Taraškievica) Wikipedia, combination of be for Belarusian and IETF language tag tarask for Taraškievica cbk-zam: – invented code used for the Zamboanga Chavacano Wikipedia (note that cbk is the correct code for the larger family of langugages Zamboanga Chavacano is a member of) fiu-vro: – invented code used for the Võro Wikipedia (not the official code vro — note that fiu is the official code for the family of languages Võro is a member of) ksh: – code used for the Ripuarian Wikipedia, even though ksh actually represents Kölsch (or Colognian) , a subset of Ripuarian map-bms: – invented code used for the Banyumasan Wikipedia (note that map does represent the family of languages the Banyumasan dialect falls within) nds-nl: – invented code used for Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia would technically be the correct code for Low Saxon spoken in the Netherlands (i.e., nds-NL ), but is therefore redundant with nds: , the code used for the Low German/Low Saxon Wikipedia (note that nds is the correct code for the Low German/Low Saxon family of languages, which Dutch Low Saxon is a member of) nrm: – code used for the Norman Wikipedia (not the official code nrf — note that nrm is the official code for the completely unrelated language Narom ) roa-rup: – invented code used for the Aromanian Wikipedia (not the official code rup — note that roa is the standard code for the larger family of Romance languages that Aromanian is a member of) roa-tara: – invented code used for the Tarantino Wikipedia (again, roa is the standard code for the large family of Romance languages that the Tarantino dialect falls within) sh: – deprecated code used for the Serbo-Croatian Wikipedia (not the official code hbs ) simple: – invented code used for the Simple English Wikipedia (which is just an IETF language tag, not the formal code en-simple ) zh-classical: – invented code used for the Classical Chinese Wikipedia (not the official code lzh ) zh-min-nan: – invented code used for the Southern Min Wikipedia (not the official code nan ) zh-yue: – invented code used for the Cantonese Wikipedia (not the official code yue ) Note that renaming wiki subdomains is very difficult , which is why so many of these nonstandard codes are still in use despite the existence of alternatives. Redirects be-x-old: – redirects to be-tarask: (see above section) cz: – redirects to cs: (the Czech Wikipedia) dk: – redirects to da: (the Danish Wikipedia) jp: – redirects to ja: (the Japanese Wikipedia) mo: – redirects to ro: (as discussed above , the Moldovan Wikipedia now redirects to the Romanian Wikipedia) nan: – redirects to zh-min-nan: (the Southern Min Wikipedia) nb: – redirects to no: (the Norwegian Wikipedia using Bokmål orthography ) yue: – redirects to zh-yue: (the Cantonese Wikipedia) Non-language subdomains nostalgia: – A read-only snapshot of Wikipedia's early days. sep11: – The Sep11wiki existed with a .wikipedia.org URL from 2001 to 2008, despite its totally different scope and purpose from all other Wikipedias. It was made read-only in 2006 and closed two years later. ten: – Used for Wikipedia 10 , the 10th anniversary of Wikipedia celebration events. (Since \" ten \" is an ISO language code for the extinct Tama language in Colombia , the interwiki prefix \" tenwiki: \" is now used to refer to this site.)

The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (\"we\" or \"us\" or \"Foundation\"), is a non-profit charitable organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California, United States, whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge. To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki projects and their editions (as explained on our Wikimedia Projects page ) (hereby referred to as \"Projects\") and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity. We welcome you (\"you\" or the \"user\") as a reader, or contributor of the Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use (\"Terms of Use\"). Overview These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with rare exceptions, such as under policies like these Terms of Use, for legal compliance, or when faced with urgent threats of serious harm). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content. The community – the network of users who are constantly building and using the Projects and/or their websites (hereby referred to as \"Project Websites\") – is the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our Projects and Project Websites. The community also undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multilingual edition). You, the user, are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions, including the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC), which apply to all Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Since we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, content you contribute is made available under a free license or released in the public domain. Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and reuse of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include laws where you or the subject of your contributions are located). This means it is important that you exercise caution when posting, modifying or reusing content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot do, most of which are either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of an appropriate professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety. For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation. Unless otherwise stated by the Foundation as an authorized party on a given Project's Website, those other organizations have no responsibility for the operations of the Project's Website or its content. 1. Our Services The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development, and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here . However, we act only as a hosting service provider, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework. This infrastructure and framework allow our users to build the Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. They also allow our users to reuse that content. The infrastructure we maintain includes specialized technological infrastructure that enables users to programmatically interact with and reuse content on Projects (referred to as \"Application Programming Interface\" or \"APIs\"), and mobile applications. As used throughout the rest of the Terms of Use, our services consist of: The Project Websites we host , technological infrastructure that we maintain, and any technical spaces that we host for the maintenance and improvement of our Projects. Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and other users: We do not take an editorial role: Because the Projects are collaboratively edited, the vast majority of the content that we host is provided by users, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project Websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, unless we have expressly stated otherwise, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content on the Projects. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on the Projects, your reuse of content on the Projects, your use of the APIs, and your use of our services more generally. For your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid taking any actions that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. For other countries, this is determined on a case-by-case basis. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn users—particularly the editors, contributors, and authors—that non-U.S. authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. We generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification against the application of such laws. 2. Privacy Policy We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy , so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information. 3. Content We Host You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we host a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services. The Projects' content is for general informational purposes only: Although our Projects host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project Websites. 4. Refraining from Certain Activities The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project. We ask that all users review and follow the Universal Code of Conduct (\"UCoC\"), which lays out requirements for collegial, civil collaboration across all Projects that we host. Certain activities, whether legal or illegal under the applicable law, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on, or otherwise using, our Projects. These activities include: Harassing and Abusing Others Engaging in threats, stalking, spamming, vandalism, or harassment as described in the UCoC; Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users; Posting or modifying content with the intention to seriously harm others, such as deliberate inducements to self-harm, or deliberate triggering of epilepsy. Violating the Privacy of Others Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content); Soliciting personally identifiable information for the purposes of harassment, exploitation, or violation of privacy, or for any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 years, or under the age of majority where you are if higher than 18 years, for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors. Engaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation under the laws of the United States of America; Posting or modifying content with the intent to deceive or mislead others; Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, hiding your affiliation with any individual or entity when disclosure is required by these terms or local Project policy, or using the name or username of another person with the intent to deceive; and Engaging in fraud. Committing Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under the applicable law. Misusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography or child sexual abuse material, or encouraging, grooming, or advocating for others to create or share such material; Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law. Engaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of other users; Engaging in automated uses of the Project Websites that are abusive or disruptive of the services, violate acceptable usage policies where available, or have not been approved by the Wikimedia community; Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on an API, Project Website or the networks or servers connected with a particular Project Website; Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project Websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose; Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met: such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks; such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work); you report any vulnerabilities to the relevant developers (or fix it yourself); and you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent. Shortcut : PAID Paid Contributions Without Disclosure You must disclose each and any employer, client, intended beneficiary and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways: a statement on your user page, a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions. In addition, if you make a public posting off the Projects advertising editing services on Wikipedia in exchange for compensation of any kind, you must disclose all Wikipedia accounts you have used or will use for this service in the public posting on the third-party service. Applicable law, or Project-specific policies and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure. For example, infringing Wikimedia Trademarks (defined hereinafter at Section 6) to advertise paid editing services, removing disclosures on previously adequately disclosed paid edits, or logged-out paid editing in a manner that makes adequate disclosure a practical impossibility violate this section. A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy which may supplement or replace this section. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section (titled \"Paid Contributions Without Disclosure\") when contributing to that particular Project. For more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions . We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the provisions in section 4 of these Terms of Use. Where required, enforcement of these terms may include actions not listed in the Wikimedia Foundation Office Action Policy . If enforcement is required in new circumstances, we will make an effort within at most one (1) year to update the Office Action Policy to catalog the new type of action. Marketing Company Mediations Undisclosed editing by users receiving compensation creates an unreasonable burden on volunteer editors who investigate and enforce community policies . Therefore, for violations of this section related to undisclosed paid editing, you agree to submit to binding \"Med-Arb\" (a \"Marketing Company Mediation\") as described in section 14 of these Terms of Use. 5. Password Security You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and other security credentials, and should never disclose them to any third party. 6. Trademarks Although you have considerable freedoms for reuse of the content on the Project Websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy . 7. Licensing of Content To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects or Project Websites are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to redistribute and reuse their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to reuse and redistribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who may access it. You agree to the following licensing requirements: Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (\"CC BY-SA 4.0\"), and GNU Free Documentation License (\"GFDL\") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Reusers may comply with either license or both. The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under the particular license prescribed by the Project edition or the feature.\n\nPlease note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms of the respective licenses. Where you own Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA 4.0, you waive these rights. As an example, this means facts you contribute to the projects may be reused freely without attribution. Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the relevant license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you represent and warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with CC BY-SA (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature). For a list of compatible licenses, see Creative Commons . You shall not import content that is available solely under GFDL. You agree that, if you import text under a CC license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason. Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted reuse and redistribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy , and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to Wikimedia Commons. No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services. Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome. It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately. Re-use: Reuse of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under \"fair use\" or similar exemptions under applicable copyright law. Any reuse must comply with the underlying license(s). When you reuse or redistribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in \"Importing text,\" above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page. In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear, for example, in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, reusers should preserve them. For any non-text media, you agree to comply with the applicable license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When reusing any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses. Modifications or additions to material that you reuse: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project Website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 4.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature). When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available. With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are reusing text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself. 8. DMCA Compliance The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be reused by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers on our Projects and services. However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Lumen Database website. If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed by filing a notice under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legal wikimedia org or snail mail our designated agent . Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than the process prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, visit the Copyright Problems page . Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at info wikimedia org . 9. Third-party Websites and Resources You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects and Project Websites contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content. 10. Management of Websites The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement. It is possible to notify us of illegal content, or content that violates our Terms of Use (including all policies and other documents incorporated by reference) for other reasons by contacting us directly . However, you can typically make a request directly to the Project's community: this may be more efficient, and is more consistent with our Projects' aim to empower the user community. Each Project will usually provide \"Help\" or \"Contact\" pages for further guidance, or specific tools for reporting issues. Alternatively – if in doubt – you can ask members of the community for help, by sending an email to info wikimedia org or a more language-specific address from the Volunteer Response Team page . Please note that these mailboxes are monitored by users of the Projects, not the Foundation. As a result, they should not be threatened or issued with legal demands. If you contact the Foundation with a problem, we will typically explore whether and how existing community-led mechanisms can investigate and, where appropriate, resolve it. In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user or especially problematic content because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion (or where legally compelled), to: Investigate your use of the Projects or our services (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or an appropriate governmental request; Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, false or unverifiable information, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests; Refuse, revert, disable, or restrict access to contributions of any user who violates these Terms of Use; Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat posting of unlawful material under applicable law in line with human rights principles; Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public. Those Foundation moderation activities may be informed or performed by software (such as traffic flood (\"Denial of Service\") protection). In those cases human review is normally available, upon request . In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had their account or access blocked under this section, they are prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, the Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies. The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition. Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy . In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures. The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms of Use. If you believe we have not satisfactorily acted on a problematic content report, or if you have been subjected to a Foundation moderation action that you wish to challenge, you may be able to submit an appeal .  Other information about routes of appeal may also be explained to you at the time, or in Project-specific help pages. We reserve the right to suspend (temporarily, or permanently) our handling of reports or other correspondence from users or third parties, whether about allegedly illegal or otherwise problematic content or conduct, or requesting appeals against moderation actions, if such correspondence was made in bad faith, repetitive, unfounded, and/or abusive. In appropriate circumstances, your email address may even be blocked on our email system(s), and you will then need to contact us at our postal address if you wish to further correspond with us during that block. For less serious cases (e.g. up to three polite emails about one or more meritless complaints), this is likely to be temporary. More frequent or more abusive communications are more likely to lead to permanent measures. 11. Resolutions and Project Policies The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable. 12. API Terms We make available a set of APIs, which include documentation and associated tools, to enable users to build products that promote free knowledge. By using our APIs, you agree to abide by all applicable policies governing the use of the APIs, which include but are not limited to the User-Agent Policy , the Robot Policy , and the API:Etiquette (collectively, \"API Documentation\"), which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference. 13. Termination Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions and a record of your activities on or in relation to the Projects (including any correspondence you have sent us) will be unaffected (subject to applicable policies), and you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. However, regardless of any other provision in these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-16, and 18. 14. Disputes and Jurisdiction Highlighted for emphasis We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use. To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred). Marketing Company Mediations As described in section 4 of these Terms of Use, you agree to resolve violations of the Paid Contributions without Disclosure in a Marketing Company Mediation at the Foundation's discretion. Marketing Company Mediations are binding mediations where, at the end of either a half or full day session, any disputed items that remain unresolved will be decided by the mediator in a legally binding decision. They will be conducted in meetings by teleconference or videoconference. If an in-person meeting is required, then the Marketing Company Mediation will take place in San Francisco County, California. The parties will split all fees and expenses related to the mediation/arbitration equally. You agree, as part of a Marketing Company Mediation, to cooperate with the Foundation, including by timely providing any documentation in your possession relating to your undisclosed paid editing activities including the accounts used, articles affected, and clients who purchased such services. Marketing Company Mediations are subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act to the extent that the mediator becomes an arbitrator. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees (including all fees necessary to determine the applicability of the Marketing Company Mediation and to enforce the binding result) and all costs relating to the investigation and enforcement of its rights. A party may be deemed \"prevailing\" even if it is not successful on every claim asserted. If for some reason the entirety of these Marketing Company Mediation requirements are found to be unenforceable, you agree to resolve any disputes as described in the beginning of this section. 15. Disclaimers Highlighted for emphasis At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure. We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice. Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law. 16. Limitation on Liability Highlighted for emphasis The Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (US$1,000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 17. Modifications to these Terms of Use Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice. Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-l . However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services. 18. Other Terms These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, joint control or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation. For the purposes of European Economic Area law, United Kingdom law, or other laws that involve a similar concept, you are not acting \"under the authority of\" the Foundation when you use the services. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control. You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Projects or Project Websites. If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision. You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Projects or Project editions. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect. Thank You! We appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services. Through your contributions, you are helping to build something really big – not only an important collection of collaboratively edited reference Projects that provides education and information to millions who might otherwise lack access, but also a vibrant community of like-minded and engaged peers, focused on a very noble goal. These Terms of Use went into effect on June 7, 2023. Previous versions of the terms: Terms of Use (2014–2023) : effective from June 16, 2014, until June 7, 2023 Terms of Use (2012–2014) : effective from May 24, 2012, until June 16, 2014 Terms of Use (2009) : effective from 2009 until May 24, 2012 Please note that in the event of any differences in meaning or interpretation between the original English version of this content and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

To that end, we have created this Cookie Statement as a clear reference guide to the use of cookies on Wikimedia Sites. This Cookie Statement explains how we use cookies (and other locally stored data technologies), how we use third-party cookies, and how you can manage your cookie options. For more information on our privacy practices, please visit our Privacy Policy . The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, actively collects some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels , JavaScript , and a variety of \"locally stored data\" technologies, such as cookies and local storage . What is a cookie?

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For statistics about Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Statistics . The normal distribution in Statistics Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing, reading and presenting data. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Descriptive statistics make summaries of data. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Inferential statistics makes predictions. [ 6 ] Statistics helps in the study of many other fields, such as science , medicine , [ 7 ] economics , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] psychology , [ 10 ] politics [ 11 ] and marketing . [ 12 ] Someone who works in statistics is called a statistician . In addition to being the name of a field of study, the word \"statistics\"  can also mean numbers that are used to describe data or relationships. History [ change | change source ] The first known statistics are census data. The Babylonians did a census around 3500 BC , the Egyptians around 2500 BC, and the Ancient Chinese around 1000 BC. Several mathematicians during the Islamic Golden Age studied statistical inference , mainly for use in cryptanalysis . Starting in the 16th century, mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano developed the probability theory ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] this led statistics closer to being a science. Since then, people have collected and studied statistics on many things. Trees , starfish , stars , rocks , words , almost anything that can be counted has been a subject of statistics. Collecting data [ change | change source ] Before we can describe the world with statistics, we must collect data . The data that we collect in statistics are called measurements . After we collect data, we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement. For example, suppose that we want to find out how popular a certain TV show is. We can pick a group of people (called a sample ) out of the total population of viewers. Then we ask each viewer in the sample how often they watch the show. The sample is data that one can see, and the population is data that one cannot see (assuming that not every viewer in the population are asked). For another example, if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure , we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after. Descriptive and inferential statistics [ change | change source ] Numbers that describe the data one can see are called descriptive statistics. Numbers that make predictions about the data one cannot see are called inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves using numbers to describe features of data. For example, the average height of women in the United States is a descriptive statistic: it describes a feature (average height) of a population (women in the United States). Once the results have been summarized and described, they can be used for prediction. This is called inferential statistics . As an example, the size of an animal is dependent on many factors. Some of these factors are controlled by the environment, but others are by inheritance. A biologist might therefore make a model that says that there is a high probability that the offspring will be small in size—if the parents were small in size. This model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random. Testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those who are given a placebo. Methods [ change | change source ] Most often, we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments . For example, an opinion poll is one kind of survey. We pick a small number of people and we choose questions to ask them. Then, we use their answers as the data. This process of choosing which data to collect is called choosing a measurement; and the process of collecting data (in this case, who to ask) is called sampling . Samples [ change | change source ] The choice of how to collect data is important; that choice can change the values that are seen. Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake. If we take samples next to the waste drain, we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far-away and hard-to-reach spot of the lake. There are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples: If there are many samples, the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real population . If there are very few samples, however, they might be very different from what they are in the real population.  This error is called sampling error (see also Errors and residuals in statistics ). If chosen samples only account for one part of the population (like samples near the drain the beginning of the section), the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population. This is true even if a great number of samples is taken. This kind of error is called bias . Errors [ change | change source ] We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample, and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly. However, sometimes large random samples are hard to take. And bias can happen if different people are not asked, or refuse to answer our questions, or if they know they are getting a fake treatment. These problems can be hard to fix. See standard error for more. Descriptive statistics [ change | change source ] Finding one value to act in place of multiple data values [ change | change source ] Often, people find it easier to decrease the numbers that make up a set of data and work with a single number instead; many people think that the best number to choose is a number in the middle of the data (a \"typical\" value of the population). This number in the middle of the data is called its central tendency . There are three kinds of central tendencies that are often used: the mean (sometimes called the average), the median and the mode . The examples below use this sample data: Name A B C D E F G H I J Score 23 26 49 49 57 64 66 78 82 92 Mean [ change | change source ] The formula for the commonly used mean (the so-called \"arithmetic mean\") is [ 18 ] x ¯ = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N x i = x 1 + x 2 + ⋯ + x N N {\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}={\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}x_{i}={\\frac {x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots +x_{N}}{N}}} Where x 1 , x 2 , … , x N {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{N}} are the data and N {\\displaystyle N} is the population size (see also Sigma Notation ). This means that one calculates the mean by adding up all the values , and then divide by the number of values. For the example above, the mean is: x ¯ = ( 23 + 26 + 49 + 49 + 57 + 64 + 66 + 78 + 82 + 92 ) / 10 = 58.6 {\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}=(23+26+49+49+57+64+66+78+82+92)/10=58.6} The problem with the mean is that it is affected by very large or very small values. In statistics, these extreme values might be errors of measurement, but sometimes the population really does contain these values. If a set of data has one of these values, then the mean may not be similar to most or all of the original values. For example, if there are 10 people in a room who make $10 per day and 1 who makes $1,000,000 per day, then the mean of the data is $90,918 per day. The average also does not work if a set of data includes multiple groups that are much different that each other. In a room of 10 people with five people who make $10 and five people who make $100 per day, the average of these data is $55 per day. In both cases, the mean is not the amount any single person makes; this fact makes the mean not very useful for some purposes. Other kinds of means exist, like the geometric mean ; other means are useful for other purposes. Median [ change | change source ] The median is the middle item of the data. For a given data X {\\displaystyle X} , this is sometimes written as X ~ {\\displaystyle {\\widetilde {X}}} . [ 18 ] To find the median, we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number, and then choose the number in the middle. If there is an even number of data, there will not be a number right in the middle, so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean. In our example above, there are 10 items of data, the two middle ones are \"57\" and \"64\", so the median is (57+64)/2 = 60.5. As another example, like the income example presented for the mean, consider a room with 10 people who have incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000. Here, the median is $55, because $55 is the average of the two middle numbers, $50 and $60.  If the extreme value of $1,000,000 is ignored, the mean is $53.  In this case, the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out.  The median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the first example in the definition of mean above. However, the median still does not work as well for data made of multiple groups. In a room of 10 people with five people who make $10 and five people who make $100 per day, the median of these data is still $55 per day, which is still not similar to most of the people in the room. Mode [ change | change source ] The mode is the most frequent item of data. For example, if there are 10 people in a room with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, then the mode is $90, because $90 occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times. There can be more than one mode. For example, if there are 10 people in a room with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $20, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, the modes are $20 and $90. This is bi-modal, or has two modes. Bi-modality is very common, and it often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups.  For instance, the average height of all adults in the U.S. has a bi-modal distribution.  This is because males and females have separate average heights of 1.763 m (5 ft 9 + 1⁄2 in) for men and 1.622 m (5 ft 4 in) for women.  These peaks are apparent when both groups are combined. The mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order. Finding the spread of the data [ change | change source ] Another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is. A common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation . If the standard deviation of a set of data is small, then most of the data is very close to the average. If the standard deviation is large, though, then a lot of the data is very different from the average. The standard deviation of a sample is generally different from the standard deviation of its originating population . Because of that, we write σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } for population standard deviation, and s {\\displaystyle s} for sample standard deviation. [ 18 ] If the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution , then it is very useful to know the standard deviation. If the data follows this pattern (we would say the data is normally distributed ), about 68 of every 100 pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation. Not only that, but about 95 of every 100 measurements will be off the average by less than two times the standard deviation, and about 997 in 1000 will be closer to the average by less than three standard deviations. Other descriptive statistics [ change | change source ] We also can use statistics to find out that some percent , percentile , number , or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category . For example, social scientists used statistics to find out that 49% of people in the world are males .

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Map of Earth with country borders and big cities shown Geography (from Greek : γεωγραφία , geographia , literally \"earth description\") [ 1 ] is the study of earth and its people and one of social sciences . [ 2 ] Its features are things like continents , seas , rivers and mountains . Its inhabitants are all the people and animals that live on it. Its phenomena are the things that happen like tides , winds , and earthquakes . A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer . A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed. [ 3 ] Geography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography . Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment. The human environmental studies would include things such as the population in a country, how a country's economy is doing, and more. There is also environmental geography. Maps are a main tool of geography, so geographers spend much time making and studying them. Making maps is called cartography , and people who specialize in making maps are cartographers. Branches [ change | change source ] Physical geography [ change | change source ] See the main article: Physical geography Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an Earth science . It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of lithosphere , hydrosphere , atmosphere , pedosphere, and global flora and fauna patterns ( biosphere ). Physical geography can be divided into many broad categories, including: Biogeography Climatology & Meteorology Coastal geography Environmental management Geodesy Geomorphology Glaciology Hydrology & Hydrography Landscape ecology Oceanography Pedology Palaeogeography Quaternary science Human geography [ change | change source ] A crowd of people around a band. Human geography is the social science that covers the study of people and their communities, cultures, economies and their interaction with the environment. Geographers studying the human environment may look at: Population Countries of the world Land use Agriculture City Industry Energy Pollution History [ change | change source ] The oldest known world map dates back to ancient Babylon from the 9th century BC. [ 4 ] The best known Babylonian world map is the Imago Mundi of 600 BC. [ 5 ] Star charts (maps of the sky) are of similar age. During the Middle Ages , people in Europe made fewer maps. People in the eastern countries made more. [ 6 ] Abū Zayd al-Balkhī created the \"Balkhī school\" of mapping in Baghdad . [ 7 ] Western Europe became known as the leader of geographic thought during the European Renaissance and The Age of Exploration (1400–1600). The printing press made maps and information about the world available to everyone. This caused more interest in how the world worked. In the 1700s and 1800s scientists started to study the relationship between the environment and its people Related pages Geographer Geographical renaming Geopolitics International Geographical Union Landform Map Navigator References [ change | change source ] ↑ Harper, Douglas. \"Online Etymology Dictionary\" .

Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy This is a summary of the Privacy Policy. To read the full terms, scroll down or click here . Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full Privacy Policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to our Privacy Policy. Because we believe that you should not have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may: Read, edit, or use any Wikimedia Site without registering an account . Register for an account without providing an email address or real name. Because we want to understand how Wikimedia Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you: Make public contributions . Register an account or update your user page. Use the Wikimedia Sites. Send us emails or participate in a survey or give feedback . We are committed to: Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy. Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure . Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes. Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the Wikimedia Sites , to comply with the law , or to protect you and others . Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. Be aware: Any content you add or any change that you make to a Wikimedia Site will be publicly and permanently available . If you add content or make a change to a Wikimedia Site without logging in , that content or change will be publicly and permanently attributed to the IP address used at the time rather than a username. Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the Wikimedia Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the Wikimedia Sites and enforce policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to all sites and services run by the Wikimedia Foundation, such as sites or services that have their own privacy policy (like the Wikimedia Shop ) or sites or services run by third parties (like third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services ). As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites. Introduction Use of info Sharing Protection Important info Introduction Welcome! The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia , Wikimedia Commons , and Wiktionary . This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information. We collect very little Personal Information about you. We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties. By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy. The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial. We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important. We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites. We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you. After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive. Definitions Back to top We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like \"tracking pixels\" and \"cookies\" used in the Privacy Policy. Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful. Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations: When we say... ...we mean: \"the Wikimedia Foundation\" / \"the Foundation\" / \"we\" / \"us\" / \"our\" The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites. \"Wikimedia Sites\" / \"our services\" Wikimedia websites and services (regardless of language), including our main projects , such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), emails, and notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the \"What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover\" section below. \"you\" / \"your\" / \"me\" You, regardless of whether you are an individual, group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the Wikimedia Sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else. \"this Policy\" / \"this Privacy Policy\" This document, entitled the \"Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy\". \"contributions\" Content you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites. \"Personal information\" Information you provide us or information we collect that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be \"personal information\" if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you: (a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, payment account number; (b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion. \"third party\" / \"third parties\" Individuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This includes other Wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimedia chapters , thematic organizations , and user groups as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients , and contractors of those organizations or groups. What This Privacy Policy Does and Does Not Cover Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below. Expand Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language: All of our major sites (found at list of major projects ), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards. Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services). Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications. Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you. This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop ) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services ). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below. Expand More on what the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy does not cover This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy. Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include: Wikipedia Store (covered by the shop's policy ); donate.wikimedia.org , including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy ); and The Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension , which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy . This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded. If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy. Community members The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. This global community of volunteers may sometimes have access to personal Information in order to ensure the functioning of the Wikimedia Sites. Administrative volunteers , such as CheckUsers or Stewards . These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to nonpublic personal data policy , as well as other, tool-specific policies. Tool providers . We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org . When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on. Other users . We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include: posting to Foundation-hosted email lists; requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to info wikimedia.org goes to this system); emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the \"Email this user\" feature); and chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel). Third parties This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of: Websites run by other organizations , like websites linked to from the \"References\" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations . These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies. Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals . These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies. Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy wikimedia.org so we can investigate. Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy , the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy. Back to top Collection & Use of Info Types of Information We Receive From You & How We Get It Your Public Contributions Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone. When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the \"How We Use Information We Receive From You\" section of this Privacy Policy. Expand Publicly Visible Information Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions. You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender. Back to top Account Information & Registration You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site. If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the \"Email this user\" feature for example). If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address . Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem! You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances . However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device. If you want to create a standard account , in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password. Expand More on Usernames Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information. Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects. To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that. Back to top Location Information GPS & Other Location Technologies Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in. If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ . Back to top Metadata Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata , such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device. Back to top IP Addresses Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server ) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location . Back to top Information Related to Your Use of the Wikimedia Sites We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites. Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you. We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy. Back to top Information We Receive Automatically Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser , your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system , in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites. Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends. Back to top Information We Collect We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you. We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels , JavaScript , and a variety of \"locally stored data\" technologies, such as cookies and local storage . These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them. Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address ), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information. We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org . Expand More on Locally Stored Data Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like: Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area. Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you. Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in. Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you. Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field. Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ . We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ . While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data. While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site. Back to top How We Use Information We Receive From You General We and our service providers use your information for the legitimate purpose of pursuing our charitable mission, including: Expand Operating the Wikimedia Sites, sharing your contributions and administering our Services. To help you share your knowledge with the world and add new features to our Services. To arrange access to your account and provide you with related service. To send administrative information to you, such as changes to our policies. To allow you to send messages to another person if you choose to do so. Direct communications between users (such as messages sent through the \"Email this user\" feature), to the extent such communications are nonpublic and stored in or in transit through Wikimedia Foundation systems, are kept confidential by us, except as provided in this Policy. We engage in these activities to manage our relationship with you, because we have a legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations. Expand Providing customized Services. To provide to you custom content, notices and settings and to enhance your experience with the Wikimedia Sites. We will customize the Services, in some instances, with your consent; or in keeping with our legitimate interest. Expand Sending emails with news updates and communications about items we believe may be of interest to you. To let you know about things that are happening with the Wikimedia Foundation, the Wikimedia Sites or the Wikimedia movement. To alert you when there has been a change to an article that you have decided to follow. We will send these types of emails to you only with your consent except as otherwise permitted by applicable law. We do not sell, rent, or use your email address to advertise third-party products or services to you. You can manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences and User profile. You can learn more about email and notifications and how to change your preferences in our FAQ . Expand Sending optional surveys and requesting feedback. We will always tell you, at the time we give you an opportunity to share your thoughts, how we plan on using your answers and any Personal Information you provide. Your responses to our surveys and feedback requests are always optional. We will email these types of requests to you only with your consent except as otherwise permitted by applicable law. You can manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences and User profile. You can learn more about email and notifications and how to change your preferences in our FAQ . Expand Improving the Wikimedia Sites and making your user experience safer and better. To use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used. To fight spam, identity theft, malware and other kinds of abuse. To optimize mobile and other applications. To test features to see what works, understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites and analyze trends. We engage in these activities to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations. Back to top Other Location information GPS & Other Location Technologies As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites. Back to top Metadata As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device. Back to top IP Addresses When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled \"For Legal Reasons\" and \"To Protect You, Ourselves & Others.\" Back to top Sharing When May We Share Your Information? We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below. With Your Permission We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ . Back to top For Legal Reasons We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our Requests for user information procedures and guidelines . We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations. We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you. For more information, see our Subpoena FAQ . Back to top If the Organization is Transferred (Really Unlikely!) In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Back to top To Protect You, Ourselves & Others We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to: enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies; protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person. We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations. We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use , this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions. Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy . These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation. We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.) Back to top To Our Service Providers We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission. We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our FAQ . If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page . Back to top To Understand & Experiment We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites. We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites. When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest. The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites. Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites. When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ .) Back to top Because You Made It Public Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone. Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere. Back to top Protection How Do We Protect Your Personal Information? We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures). We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email . Back to top How Long Do We Keep Your Data? Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law. Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ .) Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your IP address (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines . Back to top Your rights If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us. For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ . If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may Contact Us . We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law. Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.

Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the \"When May We Share Your Information\" section of this Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to do so in the following manner: In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for an open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list. For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list. We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy.

Znany głównie ze swojej roli w ekspedycjach morskich na północ. Zajmuje poczesne miejsce w mormońskiej teologii, szczególnie w kontekście związków Kościoła z Polinezyjczykami. Postać Hagota, stanowiąca integralną część szerszej kultury mormońskiej, pojawia się również w dociekaniach apologetów tej tradycji religijnej, usiłujących dowieść autentyczności Księgi Mormona . Wzmianki o nim zawiera 63. rozdział Księgi Almy , wchodzącej w skład tej właśnie części mormońskiego kanonu pism świętych. Istnienie Hagota, a także związane z nim hipotezy nie znalazły potwierdzenia w źródłach zewnętrznych. Utrwalony w sztuce. Znalazł się wśród postaci ujętych na płaskorzeźbach zdobiących świątynię mormońską w hawajskim Lāʻie . Stoi na nim na prawo od Jezusa Chrystusa , obok okrętu, trzyma też w ręku wiosło.

Dobry artykuł Lista występów Sarah Bernhardt –  w trwającej ponad 60 lat karierze Sarah Bernhardt występowała na scenie i w filmach. Zagrała w przeszło 160 sztukach oraz 8 produkcjach fabularnych . Uznawana jest za jedną z najwybitniejszych aktorek w historii teatru , legendę, największą tragiczkę i najbardziej znaną kobietę swoich czasów, a także pionierkę kina. Pierwszą styczność ze sceną miała w latach nauki w szkole w Neuilly-Auteuil-Passy, gdzie wystąpiła w amatorskim przedstawieniu Klotylda , portretując Królową Wróżek. Karierę sceniczną rozpoczęła na początku lat 60. XIX wieku, występując w Comédie-Française . Pierwszym sukcesem i przełomem w jej karierze były występy w tragedii Atalia z 1867 roku. Status gwiazdy zyskała główną kreacją w dramacie romantycznym Ruy Blas . Była jedną z pierwszych aktorek, która zagrała w filmie – Pojedynek Hamleta z 1900 roku. Zrewolucjonizowała styl gry, odrzucając powszechnie stosowaną przez uczelnie i teatry tradycję na rzecz naturalności. Czytaj więcej… Inne Dobre Artykuły • Jak pisać w stylu encyklopedycznym?

The BRFA for Bot873 excludes anything outside of user talk pages and admin related pages (decided on by the admins). Above, we had a discussion to change the settings for the archiving of this page, without realizing this page (and namespace) was purposefully excluded by the operator due to policy on requiring consensus for any public page that is outside the above named \"namespaces.\" The current settings for this page archiving is as follows: Archive any discussion that has not been edited in the last 45 days (using the last time stamp in the discussion) Must leave the last three (3) discussions (regardless of how old) on the page.

Neptune On the front page as of now, the picture is different. I've seen this happen before, but I was ignored. In the article, they use a completely different picture rather than the one of the front page. LOLHWAT ( talk ) 11:42, 16 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ LOLHWAT I believe it picks a random picture from the article. Thanks, and be well! - PDL Talk to me! Please don't eat da 🐑! 11:50, 17 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ PotsdamLamb and LOLHWAT : The article previews on the main page come from subpages of Wikipedia:Very good articles . For example, this one is at Wikipedia:Very good articles/Neptune . These do not update automatically so they have to be updated by a person, when the article is changed. About the picture of Neptune: I liked the one on the front page better, but sadly, it's a false color image, so we should probably update it to use the true color image that's displayed on Neptune . Kk.urban ( talk ) 19:21, 17 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] English: Uploader's notes: The original NASA/Cowart PNG image has been modified by flattening (combining layers), cropping and converting to JPEG format. Original caption released with image: Voyager 2 Narrow Angle Camera image of Neptune taken on August 20, 1989 as the spacecraft approached the planet for a flyby on August 25. The Great Dark Spot, flanked by cirrus clouds, is at center. A smaller dark storm, Dark Spot Jr., is rotating into view at bottom left. Additionally, a patch of white cirrus clouds to its north, named \"Scooter\" for its rapid motion relative to other features, is visible. This image was constructed using orange, green and synthetic violet (50/50 blend of green filter and UV filter images) taken between 626 and 643 UT.

LOLHWAT ( talk ) 22:03, 17 April 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Inquiry How many articles are there in Simple Wikipedia? Brick No.2 ( talk ) 06:08, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Special:Statistics says there are slighlty more than 254.000 \"content pages\". I guess that includes the \"Wikipedia:\" namespace, which is mostly about coordinating the project. There are likely less than 50 pages there, so it doesn't really influence the count. Eptalon ( talk ) 07:02, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Why did you add the decimal point? Or was it a typo (meaning the number would be 254 000 Brick No.2 ( talk ) 09:05, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] The thousands separator is either a full stop (.), a comma (,) or a space. Eptalon ( talk ) 09:11, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Is that a foreign thing or something? In Australia the full stop isn't used to separate thousands - or at least I don't think so. There is a chance that I am wrong. Brick No.2 ( talk ) 09:17, 21 July 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] It is one of the things that are also part of Internationalisation (I18N) that are often forgotten. It varies by counrty.-- Eptalon ( talk ) 07:56, 1 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Best way to use a fair use non free EN wiki file here? Trying to update a article the  English wiki has one but its fair use and tried using it here and it did not work and could not find a way to upload other than commons but they do not accept non free files what is the best way is it to link to URL of the the EN wiki file  or link to the URL official image? Commons does not have a similar file. Isla ( talk ) 11:54, 25 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] @ Isla : At this time, it is not possible to do that. As it happens, there is a current discussion about this at Wikipedia:Simple_talk#Non-free_images . By the way, please use WP:Simple talk for questions like this. The page we're on is for discussing the main page. Thanks. -- Auntof6 ( talk ) 04:38, 26 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Unfortunately there is no such way because Simple is still stuck in 2004. – Davey 2010 Talk 14:18, 26 August 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Removal/change of Wikispecies URL The species:Main Page (Simple English) page that the Wikispecies URL redirects to has been deleted over at Wikispecies for the reason, Per similar other multilingual projects, there is no need for an explicitly simple English page here. It may be appropriate to move it down to \"In Regular English:\" and point the URL at species:Main Page ? Ternera ( talk ) 16:03, 25 September 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] I've pointed the URL to species:Main Page , I haven't moved it for now as I think (not 100% certain) it's referring to the project in general. For example, Wikidata is on there even though it doesn't have a Simple English specific Main Page. Looking at some random Wikispecies pages, I believe they are reasonably simple for our readers to understand. -- Ferien ( talk ) 16:22, 25 September 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Retrieved from \" https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page&oldid=9816698 \" Hidden categories: Wikipedia semi-protected talk pages Pages using Template:Annual readership This page was last changed on 9 October 2024, at 05:30.
